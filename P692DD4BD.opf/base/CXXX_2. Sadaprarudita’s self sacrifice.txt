2. Sadaprarudita’s self-sacrificeThe Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita then had a supreme, a most sublime
feeling of zest and joy: “It is a gain to me, a very great gain that, by asking for
the perfection of wisdom and for this disquisition, I have wrought the weal of so many beings.(518)
That alone should bring me merit sufficient for the accomplishment of full enlightenment.Unquestionably
I shall become a Tathagata.”In his zest and joy he rose seven palm
trees high into the air, and, standing at the height of seven palm trees, he reflected: “How
can I, standing here in the air, do honour to the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata?” Sakra, Chief
of Gods, saw him, read his thoughts, presented him with heavenly Mandarava flowers, and
said to him: “Honour the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata with these heavenly flowers!For we feel
that we should honour the man who helped you.Today your might has wrought the weal of many
thousands of living beings.Rare are the beings who, like you, have the strength, for the
sake of all beings through countless aeons to bear the great burden.”

The Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita then took the Mandarava flowers from Sakra, Chief of Gods, and
scattered them over the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata.He presented the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata
with his own body,and said to him: “I give you myself as a present, and I shall be your attendant
and servant from today onwards.”And with folded hands he stood before Dharmodgata.

(519) The merchant’s daughter and her five hundred maidens then said to the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita:
“We in our turn make a present of ourselves to you, son of good family. Through
this wholesome root we also shall become recipients of just those dharmas, and together with
you we shall again and again honour and revere the Buddhas and Lords,and the Bodhisattvas,
and we shall remain near to you.”Sadaprarudita replied: “If you, maidens, in imitation
of my own earnest intention, give yourselves with earnest intentions to me, then I will
accept you.”The maidens replied: “We imitate you, and with earnest resolutionwe give ourselves
as presents to you, to do with us as you will.”Thereupon the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita
presented the merchant’s daughter and her five hundred maidens, embellished and adorned,
together with their five hundred well-decorated carriages, to the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata,
and said: “All these I present to you as attendants and servants, and also the carriages
for your own use.”

Sakra, Chief of Gods, applauded him and said: “Well done, son of good family!A Bodhisattva must
renounce all his property.Through that thought of renunciation he soon wins full enlightenment,and
the worship he pays thus to the preachers of dharma enables him to hear about
the perfection of wisdom and skill in means.(520) Also in the past the Tathagatas, when they
still were Bodhisattvas, have, by the fact that they renounced everything, procured a
claim to full enlightenment; and they also have asked questions about perfect wisdom and about
skill in means.”

The Bodhisattva Dharmodgata accepted Sadaprarudita’s gift, so that his wholesome root might
reach fulfilment.Immediately afterwards he returned it to Sadaprarudita.After that, the Bodhisattva
Dharmodgata went into his house. The sun was about to set.

The Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita then thought to himself: “It would not indeed be seemly for me,
who have come here out of love for dharma, to sit or to lie down.I will remain either standing
or walking, until the time when the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata shall again come out of
his house, in order to reveal dharma to us.”

The Bodhisattva Dharmodgata then remained for seven years immersed in one uninterrupted state
of trance,and he dwelt in countless thousands of concentrations, peculiar to Bodhisattvas,
issued from perfection of wisdom and skill in means.For seven years Sadaprarudita never
adopted any other posture than the two just mentioned, and he did not fall into sloth and
torpor.For seven years he never felt any preoccupation with sense desires, or with ill will,
or with harming others, he never felt any eagerness for tastes, nor any self-satisfaction.But
he thought: “When then will the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata emerge from his trance, (521)
so that we may spread out a seat for him, whereon he may demonstrate dharma,and so that
we may sprinkle well the place where he will reveal the perfection of wisdom and skill in
means, anoint it well and bedeck it with manifold flowers?”And the merchant’s daughter with
her five hundred maidens followed his example, passed their time in two postures only,
and imitated all his works.

One day the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita heard a heavenly voice which said: “On the seventh day
from today the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata will emerge from his trance, and he will then, seated
in the center of the town, demonstrate dharma.”When Sadaprarudita heard the heavenly voice,
he was contented, elated, joyous, overjoyed and jubilant. Together with the merchant’s
daughter and her five hundred maidens he cleansed the ground, spread out the seat made
of the seven precious things, took off his upper garment, and spread it on top of the seat.The
maidens also took off their upper garments, spread their five hundred upper garments
on that seat, and thought: “Seated on that seat will the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata demonstrate
dharma.” (522,1)And they also were contented, elated, joyous, overjoyed and jubilant.

When the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita wanted to sprinkle the groundhe could not find any water,
though he searched all round.For Mara, the Evil One, had hidden all the water. And he did
this so that Sadaprarudita, if he could not find any water, should become depressed and sad,
or change his mind, with the result that his wholesome root would vanish, or the fervour
of this worship be dimmed.

The Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita then thought to himself: “Let me pierce my own body, and sprinkle
the ground with my blood.The ground is full of rising dust,and I fear that some of it
may fall on the body of the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata.What else can I do with this body which
is of necessity doomed to break up? Better surely that this my body should be destroyed
by such an action rather than by an ineffectual one.For the sake of sense pleasures, as a
result of sense pleasures many thousands frames of mine have again and again, while I wandered
in birth-and-death, been broken up, but never in conditions as favourable as these, never
for the sake of gaining the good law.If they must once more be broken up, let them in
any case be broken up in a holy cause.”He (523) then took a sharp sword, pierced his body
on every side, and everywhere sprinkled that piece of ground with his own blood.The merchant’s
daughter with her five hundred maidens followed his example, and did as he did.But there
was no alteration of thought in either the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita, or in all those
maidens, which would have given Mara, the Evil One, a chance of entering in order to obstruct
their wholesome roots.

Sakra, Chief of Gods, then thought to himself: “It is wonderful how much this Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita
loves dharma, how firm is his sense of obligation, how great the armour he has
put on, and how he disregards his body, his life, and his pleasures, and how resolutely he
has set out with the goal of knowing full enlightenment,in his desire to ‘set free all beings
from the measureless sufferings of birth-and-death, after he has known full enlightenment.”Sakra
then changed by magic all that blood into heavenly sandalwood water. And all
round that piece of ground, for one hundred leagues, an inconceivably sublime scent, the scent
of that heavenly sandalwood water, filled the air.

And Sakra said to Sadaprarudita: “Well done, son of good family!I applaud your inconceivable
vigour, your supreme love and search for dharma.The Tathagatas in the past (524) also have
procured the right to full enlightenment through this kind of earnest intention, vigour,
and love for dharma.”

The Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita then thought to himself: “I have spread out the seat for the Bodhisattva
Dharmodgata,and I have well swept and sprinkled this piece of ground.Now I must
still get flowers with which to cover this piece of ground, and to scatter over the Bodhisattva
Dharmodgata when he demonstrates dharma.” Sakra then said to Sadaprarudita: “Accept
these heavenly Mandarava flowersfor that twofold purpose!”And he presented him with a thousand
heavenly Khara measures of heavenly flowers.And the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita accepted
those flowers, and used some of them to cover the piece of ground, and, later on, he strewed
others over the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata.
