2. Fewness of bodhisattvasOn this earth, few are the places free from stones, few the spots
where gold and silver are found.Much more numerous are saline deserts, arid deserts, places
covered with grass, or thorns, or steep chasms.Just so, in the world of beings few Bodhisattvas
exist who train in this training in all-knowledge, i.e. in the training in perfect
wisdom.Much more numerous are those who train in the training characteristic of Disciples
and Pratyekabuddhas.

Furthermore, Subhuti, in the world of beings few have done deeds which lead them to the authority
of a universal monarch.Much more numerous are those who have done deeds which lead them
to the authority of a commander of a fort.Just so, in the world of beings few are the
Bodhisattvas who have mounted on this path of perfect wisdom, and who have resolved to know
full enlightenment.Much more numerous are those who have mounted on the path of Disciples
and Pratyekabuddhas.

Furthermore, few only have done deeds which permit them to become Sakra, Chief of Gods.Much
more numerous are those whose deeds lead them to the world of [the minor] Gods.Just so, few
beings only are Bodhisattvas who train in this training in perfect wisdom.Much more numerous
are the Bodhisattvas who train in the training of Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas.

(430) Furthermore, few beings only have done deeds which permit them to become Brahma.Much more
numerous are those whose deeds lead them to Brahmaâ€™s assembly.Just so, few beings only
are irreversible to full enlightenment.Much more numerous are those Bodhisattvas who turn
away from full enlightenment.Therefore then, Subhuti, in the world of beings few beings exist
who have set out for full enlightenment.Fewer are those who progress in Thusness.Still
fewer are those very few who make endeavours about perfect wisdom.Still fewer even are those
very very few Bodhisattvas who are irreversible from full enlightenment.A Bodhisattva
who wants to be numbered among those very, very few irreversible Bodhisattvas should therefore
train in just this perfection of wisdom, and make endeavours about it.

Moreover, Subhuti, no harsh thought arises to a Bodhisattva who thus trains in perfect wisdom,
nor a doubting thought, or an envious or mean thought, or an immoral thought, or a thought
of ill will, or a lazy thought, or a distracted thought, or a stupid thought.
