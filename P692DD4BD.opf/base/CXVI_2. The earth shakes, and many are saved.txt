2. The earth shakes, and many are savedWhen this disquisition of the Suchness of the Tathagata
had taken place, the great earth shook in six ways, stirred, quaked, was agitated, resounded
and tumbled, as it did when the Tathagata won full enlightenment.Subhuti: It is thus,
O Gods, that Subhuti the Elder is born after the image of the Tathagata.

But he is not born after the image of form, or of any of the fruits of a holy life, from the
fruit of a Streamwinner to Buddhahood.For those dharmas, which might be born after the image
of something, or in the image of which he would be born, they do not exist, they are not
got at.It is thus that Subhuti the Elder is born in the image of the Tathagata.

Sariputra: This Suchness, O Lord, courses in the deep!The Lord: So it is, Sariputra.But when
this disquisition of Suchness was expounded, the minds of three hundred monks were freed
from the outflows, without any further clinging. Five hundred nuns obtained the pure, dispassionate
and unstained dharma-eye. (310) Five thousand Gods, who in the past had made the
necessary preparations, acquired the patient acceptance of dharmas which fail to be produced.
And the minds of six thousand Bodhisattvas were free from the outflows, without any further
clinging.
