1. Hymm to the perfection of wisdomSariputra: The perfection of wisdom, O Lord, is the accomplishment
of the cognition of the all-knowing. The perfection of wisdom is that state of all-knowledge.The
Lord: So it is, Sariputra, as you say.Sariputra: The perfection of wisdom
gives light, O Lord.I pay homage to the perfection of wisdom!She is worthy of homage.She
is unstained,the entire world cannot stain her.She is a source of light,and from everyone
in the triple world she removes darkness,and she leads away from the blinding darkness caused
by the defilements and by wrong views.In her we can find shelter.Most excellent are her
works.She makes us seek the safety of the wings of enlightenment.She brings light to the
blind,she brings light so that all fear and distress may be forsaken.She has gained the five
eyes, and she shows the path to all beings.She herself is an organ of vision.She disperses
the gloom and darkness of delusion.(171) She does nothing about all dharmas.She guides
to the path those who have strayed on to a bad road.She is identical with all-knowledge.She
never produces any dharma, because she has forsaken the residues relating to both kinds
of coverings, those produced by defilement and those produced by the cognizable.She does
not stop any dharma.Herself unstopped and unproduced is the perfection of wisdom.She is the
mother of the Bodhisattvas, on account of the emptiness of own marks.As the donor of the
jewel of all the Buddha-dharmas she brings about the ten powers (of a Buddha).She cannot
be crushed.She protects the unprotected, with the help of the four grounds of self-confidence.She
is the antidote to birth-and-death.She has a clear knowledge of the own-being of
all dharmas, for she does not stray away from it.The perfection of wisdom of the Buddhas,
the Lords, sets in motion the wheel of the Dharma.
