4. Merit from perfect wisdomTherefore then, Subhuti, a Bodhisattva who wants to take hold of
all perfections should train in the perfection of wisdom.When he trains in the perfection
of wisdom, a Bodhisattva trains in that which is the highest possible degree of perfection
for any being.For his merit is the greatest possible.Subhuti, if you consider all the beings
in the great trichiliocosm, are they many? Subhuti: Even in Jambudvipa alone there are
many beings, how many more would there be in the great trichiliocosm?The Lord: If one single
Bodhisattva were, during his entire life, to furnish all those beings with robes, alms
bowl, lodging, medicinal appliances for use in sickness, and all that brings them happiness,
- (432) would such a Bodhisattva on the strength of that beget a great deal of merit?
Subhuti: He would, O Lord.The Lord: A much greater merit still would that Bodhisattva beget
who would develop this perfection of wisdom for even the duration of a finger-snap.So greatly
profitable is the perfection of wisdom of the Bodhisattvas, because she feeds the supreme
enlightenment.A Bodhisattva should therefore train in perfect wisdom if he wants to
know full enlightenment, to arrive at the supreme position among all beings, to become a
protector of the helpless, to reach the sphere of the Buddha, to emulate the manliness of
the Buddha, to sport with a Buddha’s sport, to roar a Buddha’s lion roar, to reach the accomplishment
of a Buddha, and to explain the dharma in the great trichiliocosm.When a Bodhisattva
trains in the perfection of wisdom, I do not see the accomplishment in which he has
not been trained.
