3. Attentions to perfect wisdom, and the pearl of great priceThe Lord: So it is, Subhuti.

Suppose, Subhuti, that all beings in Jambudvipa should simultaneously acquire a human personality,
should raise their thoughts to full enlightenment, abide in (402) that thought of enlightenment
all their lives, and honour, revere and worship all the Tathagatas all their
lives. If now [after all this preparation], they should give gifts to all beings, and turn
[the merit from] that giving over into full enlightenment,- would those Bodhisattvas on the
strength of that beget much merit? Subhuti: They would, O Lord.The Lord: Truly again, Subhuti,
that son or daughter of good family begets a greater heap of merit, who, as a Bodhisattva,
dwells for even one single day only in mental activities connected with the perfection
of wisdom.For, as he goes on dwelling day and night in those mental activities, he becomes
more and more worthy of the sacrificial gifts of all beings.Because no other being
has a mind so full of friendliness as he has, except for the Buddhas, the Lords.And the Tathagatas,
of course, are matchless,without a like,endowed with unthinkable dharmas.

How then does that son or daughter of good family at first aspire to that merit? He becomes
endowed with that kind of wise insight which allows him to see all beings as on the way to
their slaughter.Great compassion on that occasion takes hold of him.(403) He surveys countless
beings with his heavenly eye, and what he sees fills him with great agitation: so many
carry burden of a karma which leads to immediate retribution in the hells, others have
acquired unfortunate rebirths [which keep them away from the Buddha and his teachings], others
are doomed to be killed, or they are enveloped in the net of false views, or fail to
find the path,while others who had gained a fortunate rebirth have lost it again.And he attends
to them with the thought that: “I shall become a saviour to all those beings, I shall
release them from all their sufferings!”But he does not make either this, or anything else,
into a sign to which he becomes partial.This also is the great light of a Bodhisattva’s
wisdom, which allows him to know full enlightenment.For Bodhisattvas, when they dwell in
this dwelling, become worthy of the gifts of the whole world, and yet they do not turn back
on full enlightenment.They purify the gifts and offerings of those who give them the requisites
of life, when their thoughts are well supported by perfect wisdom,and they are near
to all-knowledge.Therefore a Bodhisattva should dwell in this mental work associated with
perfect wisdom, if he does not want to consume his alms fruitlessly, if he wants to point
out the path to all beings, (404) to shed light over a wide range, to set free from birth-and-death
all the beings who are subject to it, and to cleanse the organs of vision of
all beings.If he wishes to dwell in mental activities directed towards these goals, he should
bring to mind mental activities associated with the perfection of wisdom.For one who decides
to bring these to mind, his mind works on the welfare of all beings.But he should give
no room to other mental activities, such as lack in perfect wisdom.If he acts so [as the
mental work, which is essentially a loving concern for beings, impels him], he spends his
days and nights in mental activities associated with the perfection of wisdom.Suppose a
man, well versed in jewelry and the different varieties of jewels, had newly acquired a very
precious gem.That would make him very glad and elated.If he again lost this precious gem,he
would be most sad and distressed.Constantly and always mental activities associated
with that jewel would proceed in him, and he would regret to be parted from it. He would not
forget about it, until he had either regained this gem, or gained another one of like quality
and kind.Just so a Bodhisattva who has again lost the precious jewel of perfect wisdom;
(405) with a clear perception of the preciousness of perfect wisdom, and convinced that
he has not been definitely parted from it, he should, with a thought that is not lacking
in mental work on perfect wisdom, and which is directed to the state of all-knowledge, search
about everywhere until he has regained this Sutra, or gained an equivalent one.All that
time he should be one who is not lacking in mental activities associated with the acquisition
of the precious jewel of the perfection of wisdom, one who is not lacking in mental
activities associated with the acquisition of the great jewel of all-knowledge.

Subhuti: But, since the Lord has taught that all dharmas and all mental activities are lacking
in own-being, and empty, - how then can a Bodhisattva become one who is not lacking in
mental activities associated with perfect wisdom, or with all-knowledge? The Lord: If the
mind of a Bodhisattva works on the fact that all dharmas are through their own-being isolated
and empty, and agrees that that is so, then he becomes one who is not lacking in mental
activities associated with perfect wisdom and with all-knowledge.For perfect wisdom is empty,it
neither increases nor decreases.
