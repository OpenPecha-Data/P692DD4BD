3. Faults in connection with detachmentFurthermore, Mara the Evil One may come to the Bodhisattva
and exhort and inform himin connection with the quality of detachment that the Tathagata
has praised detachment, and that that means that one should dwell in the remote forest,
in a jungle, in mountain clefts, burial grounds, or on heaps of straw, etc.But that is
not what I teach as the detachment of a Bodhisattva, that he should live in a forest, remote,
lonely and isolated, or in jungle, mountain clefts, burial grounds, on heaps of straw,
etc.

Subhuti: If that is not the detachment of the Bodhisattva, what then is it? The Lord: A Bodhisattva
dwells detached when he becomes detached from the mental activities associated with
the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas (392,1).For, if he is taken hold of by perfection of wisdom
and skill in means, and if he dwells in the dwelling of friendliness and of great compassion
towards all beings, then he dwells detached even when he dwells in the neighborhood
of a village.It is I who have ordained this detachment from the mental activities associated
with the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas.A Bodhisattva dwells detached if he passes day
and night dwelling in this detachment.If a Bodhisattva dwells in this dwelling while he
lives in remote dwelling places, in the remote forest, in the jungle, in mountain clefts or
burial grounds, then he dwells detached.But as to the detachment recommended by Mara, the
Evil One, - i.e. the dwelling in remote forests, jungles, mountain clefts and burial grounds,
- if that detachment is actually contaminated by the mental activities associated with
Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas, then, as he does not practise the perfection of wisdom,
he does not fulfil the conditions necessary to win all-knowledge.He dwells in a contaminated
dwelling, in a mental activity which is not quite pure, and in consequence his deeds of
body, voice and mind cannot be quite pure.In consequence of that he despises other Bodhisattvas
who dwell in villages, but who are uncontaminated by mental activities associated with
Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas, who dwell in the dwelling of wisdom with its many devices,
and with its great compassion.Since his deeds of body, voice and mind are not quite pure,
he is just a dweller in contamination, not a dweller in detachment, although he may dwell
in the remote forest.At first he despises those who live in the neighborhood of a village,
though they dwell in the dwelling of wisdom, with its devices and great compassion, though
they are habitually quite pure in what they do with their body, voice or mind, though
they are detached from mental activities associated with Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas,
uncontaminated by them (393,1); after that he finds that the cannot gain the Trances, Concentrations,
Attainments, Emancipations and Super-knowledges,and that they do not reach their
fulfilment in him.The reason is that he is without skill in means.

Even though a Bodhisattva may dwell in deserted forests hundreds of miles wide, with no other
company than beasts of prey, antelopes, flocks of birds, uninfested even by the smaller
wild animals, by Yakshas and Rakshasas, and untroubled by the fear of robbers, and even though
he may settle there for one year, or for one hundred years, or even for hundreds of thousands
of niyutas of kotis of years, or for more than that;- if he does not know the detachment
which I have explained, and through which a Bodhisattva dwells as one who has set
out with earnest intention, who has achieved earnest intention;then even one completely devoted
to life in the remote forest fails to gladden my heart, if he does not know this [detachment],
if he is without skill in means,if he leans of that detachment of his, clings to
it, is bent on it, indulges in it.For the detachment of a Bodhisattva which I have described
does not appear in his detachment.But from a place high up in the air Mara will say to
the dweller in the remote forest that he does well, that his detachment is the one which
the Tathagata has described,that he should go on dwelling in just this detachment,and that
in consequence of it he will quickly win full enlightenment.(394) When he leaves that isolated
place in the forest, and comes back to a village, he despises the Bodhisattvas there,
monks who are well behaved, chaste, lovely in character, uncontaminated by mental activities
associated with Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas, and living lives quite pure, in body,
voice and mind.He tells them that they surely do not dwell in a detached dwelling, but in
a contaminated and crowded one.Those Bodhisattvas there, who dwell in a detached dwelling,
he warns against contaminated and crowded dwellings.He tries to commit them to a detached
dwelling [as he conceives it].He claims their respect for his isolated residence, he becomes
proud,and tells them: “Superhuman beings have exhorted me, superhuman beings have come
to inform me!This [isolated place in the forest], Subhuti, is the dwelling in which I dwell.What
dweller in a village has ever been exhorted and informed by superhuman beings?” In
this kind of way he despises the persons who belong to the vehicle of the Bodhisattva.He
should be known as a Candala of a Bodhisattva, as a defamer of Bodhisattvas, as a mere fake
of a Bodhisattva, as a counterfeit Bodhisattva, as filth of a Bodhisattva, as a robber
in the guise of a Shramana, a robber of persons belonging to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas,
a robber of the world with its Gods.Such a one should surely not be tended, loved or honoured.For
such persons have fallen into conceit.(395) They will even succeed in corrupting
other kindred spirits, weaklings who have but recently set out in the vehicle.They should
be regarded as impure by nature,as devoid of proper teachers,devoid of the qualities of
holiness.But a Bodhisattva should not tend such persons, nor love or honour them, if he is
one who has neither abandoned all beings, nor all-knowledge, nor full enlightenment, if
he wants earnestly to win full enlightenment, and to bring about the weal of all beings.On
the contrary, one who has raised himself to a height where he considers the weal of all beings,
should, so that he may see through these and other deeds of Mara, always have a mind
which is anxious to expound the path to beings who have not yet got it, a mind which does
not tremble and which is not submerged in the wanderings through the triple world;he has
first of all an attitude of friendliness, and an attitude of compassion, he has produced
the great compassion and is moved by pity, he has a thought of joy in sympathy with the beings
who progress in the right direction, he is impartial because the true nature of dharmas
is such that it cannot be apprehended; [with all this in mind] he should form the resolution:
“Thus will I act that in future all the faults of Mara’s deeds shall in no way whatsoever
either be, or be produced;or, if produced, that they shall at once pass away again.
Thus will I train myself!”This should also be known as a Bodhisattva’s courageous advance
towards his own higher knowledge.So much for what a Bodhisattva should know about Mara’s
deeds in connection with the quality of detachment.
