7. The bodhisattva sustained by the buddhasSariputra: If, O Lord, Mara, the Evil One, is determined
to cause obstacles to the study of this perfection of wisdom, how can just now people
actually study it, and through whose might can they do so? The Lord: It is through the
might of the Buddhas and Lords, of the Tathagatas, that they study it, and that they make
progress in training in Thusness.For it is in the nature of things that the Buddhas, the
Lords, who stand, hold and maintain themselves in immeasurable and incalculable world-systems,
should bring to mind and uphold everyone who teaches (223) and studies this perfection
of wisdom.The Buddhas will bring him to mind and assist him.And it is quite impossible to
cause an obstacle to someone who has been brought to mind and upheld by the Buddhas.

Sariputra: It is through the Buddhaâ€™s might, sustaining power and grace that Bodhisattvas study
this deep perfection of wisdom, and progressively train in Thusness? (224,1)

The Lord: So it is, Sariputra.They are known to the Tathagata,they are sustainedand seen by
the Tathagata,and the Tathagata beholds them with his Buddha-eye.And those Bodhisattvas who
study this perfection of wisdom, and who are progressively training in Thusness, they are
near to the Thusness of the supreme enlightenment, and they stand poised in their decision
to win full enlightenment.If they only just study this perfection of wisdom, without progressively
training in Thusness, (225) they will not stand poised in Suchness in the supreme
enlightenment; but nevertheless they also are known to the Tathagata,sustainedand seen
by the Tathagata,and the Tathagata beholds them with his Buddha-eye.That continual study
of the perfection of wisdom, and the mental excitation about it, will be greatly profitable
to them, a great advantage, fruit and reward.For, as aiming at ultimate reality, the perfection
of wisdom has been set up for the penetration by all beings into what dharmas truly
are.
