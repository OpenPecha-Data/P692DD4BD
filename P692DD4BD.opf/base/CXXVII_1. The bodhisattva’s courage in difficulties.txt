1. The bodhisattvaâ€™s courage in difficultiesSariputra: In the core and substance of things verily
courses a Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom!Subhuti: In something unsubstantial
verily courses a Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom.

Thereupon this occurred to many thousands of Gods of the realm of sense-desire: Homage is due
to those beings who raise their thoughts to, and who consummate their thoughts in full enlightenment,who
course in this deep perfection of wisdom, and who, when they course thus,
do not realize the reality-limit, be it on the level of a Disciple or that of a Pratyekabuddha.In
this way also should the Bodhisattvas be known as doers of what is hard, when they
course in the true nature of dharma, but do not realize it.Subhuti read their thoughts,
and said to them: Not that is hard for those Bodhisattvas that they do not realize the reality-limit.This,
however, is hard for them, this is most hard for them, (445) that they put
on the armour of the resolution to lead countless beings to Nirvana,when absolutely those
beings do not exist. And since they do not exist, they cannot be got at. Owing to the isolatedness
of beings,those who should be disciplined do thus absolutely not exist.It is in
this spirit that the Bodhisattvas have set out for full enlightenment, and have decided to
discipline beings. One would decide to discipline space if one were to decide to discipline
beings.For the isolatedness of beings should be known after the pattern of the isolatedness
of space.In this way also Bodhisattvas are doers of what is hard, when they put on the
armour for the sake of beings who do not exist, who cannot be got at.One would decide to
put on space if one were to decide to put on the armour for the sake of beings.And yet this
armour has been put on by the Bodhisattvas for the sake of beings.But that non-apprehension
of beings, in [ultimate end] absolute reality, has been taught by the Tathagata.And
this non-apprehension of beings can be inferred from their isolatedness, and from the isolatedness
of those who should be disciplined should the isolatedness of a Bodhi-being be inferred.If
a Bodhisattva, when this is being taught, does not lose heart, then one should know
that he courses in the perfection of wisdom.For from the isolatedness of a being should
be known the isolatedness of form, etc., and of all dharmas.(446) Thus should the isolatedness
of all dharmas be viewed.When the isolatedness of all dharmas is thus being taught,
a Bodhisattva does not lose heart,and because of that he courses in the perfection of wisdom.

The Lord: For what reason does a Bodhisattva not lose heart when the isolatedness of all dharmas
is thus being taught? Subhuti: Because of isolatedness no dharma can ever lose heart.For
one cannot get at any dharma that would lose heart,nor at any dharma that would make a
dharma lose heart.The Lord: So it is, Subhuti.It is quite certain that a Bodhisattva courses
in perfect wisdom if, when this is being taught, demonstrated, expounded and pointed out,
he does not lose heart, is not cast down or depressed, does not become cowed or stolid,
does not turn his mind away from it, does not have his back broken, and remains unafraid.
