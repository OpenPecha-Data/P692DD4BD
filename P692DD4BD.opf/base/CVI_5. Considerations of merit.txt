5. Considerations of meritThis heap of merit of a Bodhisattva, which is born from his turning
over of the Dharma-element, that is declared to be superior to the accumulation of merit
on the part of someone who would instigate to, and establish in the ten wholesome ways of
action all the beings in the great trichiliocosms which are countless as the sands of the
Ganges.And it remains superior also if those beings would all gain the four trances,or the
four Unlimited,or the four formless attainments,or (156) the five superknowledges;or equally
if they would become Streamwinners, etc.,to: Pratyekabuddhas.This is not all. (157) If
all beings in all world systems had set out for the supreme enlightenment;and if, Subhuti,
each single Bodhisattva were to furnish, for aeons countless like the sands of the Ganges,
all those beings in the various great trichiliocosms, countless as the sands of the Ganges,
with all they might need; but they would give that gift while perceiving a basis.And
if, proceeding in this manner, we imagine that all those beings are a single one, and if
each single Bodhisattva would for aeons countless as the sands of Ganges furnish all those
Bodhisattvas with all they might need, and treat them with respect;if thus each single one
of all those Bodhisattvas, if they all together would give that gift,would now those Bodhisattvas
on the strength of that beget a great deal of merit? Subhuti: A great deal indeed,
O Lord.That heap of merit would even defy calculation.If it were a material thing, it could
not find room in even the great trichiliocosms countless as the sands of the Ganges.

The Lord: So it is, Subhuti.And yet, this accumulation of merit, due to giving on the part of
the Bodhisattvas who perceive a basis, is infinitesimal compared with the merit begotten
by someone who belongs to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas, and who, taken hold of by perfection
of wisdom and by skill in means, turns that wholesome root over into full enlightenment
by means of this turning over of the dharma-element.(158) For although the basis-perceiving
Bodhisattvas have given a good many gifts, they have also reckoned them up as ‘a good
many.’

Thereupon twenty thousand Gods of the Four Great Kings, with folded hands paid homage to the
Lord, and said: “This transformation into all-knowledge of wholesome roots by those who have
been taken hold of by the perfection of wisdom and by skill in means, is a great transformation
of the Bodhisattvas. Because it surpasses the accumulation of merit, derived from
giving, of those Bodhisattvas who are based on something, however great it may be.”Thereupon
again one hundred thousand Gods of the Thirty-three rained down on the Lord heavenly
flowers, incense, perfumes, wreaths, ointments, aromatic powders, jewels and garments.They
worshipped the Lord with heavenly parasols, banners, bells, flags, and with rows of lamps
all around, and with manifold kinds of worship.They played on heavenly musical instruments
[in honour of the Lord] and they said: (159) “This transformation of the dharma-element
is surely a great transformation of the Bodhisattva. Because it surpasses the heap of accumulated
merit resulting from the gifts of the Bodhisattvas who have a basis in something,
just because that great transformation has been taken hold of by the perfection of wisdom
and by skill in means.”All the other classes of Gods appeared on the scene, worshipped the
Lord, and raised their voices.They said: “It is wonderful, O Lord, to what an extent this
transformation of a wholesome root by the Bodhisattvas who have taken hold of by the perfection
of wisdom and by skill in means surpasses the heap of merit of those Bodhisattvas who
have a basis in something, although it has accumulated for such a long time, and was procured
by such manifold exertions.”

Thereupon the Lord said to those Gods, from the gods belonging to the Pure Abode downwards:
“Let us leave the case of the accumulation of the merit of all beings in countless world systems
who have definitely set out for full enlightenment, and who have given gifts for the
sake of gaining full enlightenment. (160) Let us, in the same manner, consider the case
of all beings in countless world systems who, having made a vow to gain full enlightenment,
and having raised their thoughts to enlightenment, would give gifts on the extensive scale
described before [i.e. p. 157].On the other hand we consider a Bodhisattva, taken hold
of by the perception of wisdom and by skill in means, who takes hold of the wholesome roots
of all the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Pratyekabuddhas and Disciples, and of all other beings
also the wholesome roots which have been planted, will be planted, and are being planted,
and who rejoices over them all in the way described above.Then infinitesimal will be the
accumulation of merit on the part of the former Bodhisattvas who give gifts while perceiving
a basis - just because they perceive a basis.

(161) Subhuti: The Lord has described the jubilation over the wholesome roots of all beings
as a most excellent jubilation.For what reason is this jubilation a most excellent one? The
Lord: If a person who belongs to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas does not seize on past,
future and present dharmas, does not mind them, does not get at them, does not construct,
nor discriminate them, does not see nor review them (162,1), if he considers them with the
conviction that all dharmas are fabricated by thought construction, unborn, not come forth,
not come, not gone,and that no dharma is ever produced or stopped in the past, future
or present;if he considers those dharmas in such a way, then his jubilation is in accordance
with the true nature of those dharmas,and so is his transformation [of the merit] into
full enlightenment.This is the first reason why the jubilation of the Bodhisattva is a most
excellent one.The meritorious work founded on giving on the part of Bodhisattvas who perceive
a basis, who have a basis in view, is infinitesimal compared with the transformation
of the wholesome root by that Bodhisattva.

Moreover, Subhuti, someone who belongs to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas, and who wants to
rejoice in the wholesome roots of all the Buddhas and Lords, should rejoice in such a way:
As emancipation [is unoriginated, since the obstacles from defilements and from the cognizable
have ceased], so the gift; so the morality, etc.; so the jubilation, so the meritorious
work founded on jubilation; (163) as the emancipation, so the transformation, so the Buddhas
and Lords, and the Pratyekabuddhas, and the Disciples who have entered Parinirvana;
as the emancipation, so are the dharmas which are past, or stopped; and likewise the dharmas
which are future, or not yet produced; and the dharmas which are present, or proceeding
just now; as the emancipation so are all the past, future and present Buddhas and Lords.Thus,
I rejoice with the most excellent jubilation in the true nature of those dharmas, which
are unbound, unfreed, unattached.Thereafter I turn that meritorious work founded on jubilation
over into full enlightenment; but really no turning over takes place, because nothing
is passed on, nothing destroyed.This is the second reason why the jubilation of the Bodhisattva
is a most excellent one.(164) But to return to the question of merit. Let us now
consider the case where all the beings in countless world systems have definitely set out
for full enlightenment, and where, in order to advance to full enlightenment, they would
for countless aeons undertake the obligation of observing morality, i.e. good conduct of
body, speech and mind, - but while perceiving a basis.Nevertheless their accumulation of merit
is infinitesimal compared with that of a Bodhisattva’s merit derived from jubilation,
- just because they perceive a basis.(165) And the same would be true, if all those beings
would for countless aeons practice patience, although they were ever so much abused, struck
and reviled;(166) or if they would practice vigour, and under no circumstances would be
cast down, or conquered by sloth and torpor;(168) or, finally, if they would enter the trances.As
long as they carry out those practices while perceiving a basis, their merit will
be infinitesimal compared with that of a Bodhisattva who rejoices over the wholesome roots
of all beings with the most excellent jubilation, and transforms this wholesome root into
the supreme enlightenment.
