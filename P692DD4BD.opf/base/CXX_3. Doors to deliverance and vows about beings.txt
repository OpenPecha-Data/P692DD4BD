3. Doors to deliverance and vows about beingsSubhuti: A doer of what is hard is the Bodhisattva,a
doer of what is most hard, if he courses and dwells in emptiness, if he enters into
the concentration on emptiness, and yet does not realise the reality-limit!Exceedingly wonderful
is this, O Well-Gone!The Lord: So it is, Subhuti.For the Bodhisattva has not abandoned
all beings.He has made the special vows to set free all those beings.If the mind of a
Bodhisattva forms the aspiration not to abandon all beings but to set them free, and if in
addition he aspires for the concentration on emptiness, the Signless, the Wishless, i.e.
for the three doors to deliverance, then that Bodhisattva should be known as one who is endowed
with skill in means, and he will not realise the reality-limit midway, before his Buddha-dharmas
have become complete.For it is this skill in means which protects him.His thought
of enlightenment (376) consists in just that fact that he does not want to leave all
beings behind.When he is thus endowed with the thought of enlightenment and with skill in
means, then he does not midway realise the reality-limit.

Moreover, while a Bodhisattva either actually contemplates those deep stations, i.e. the three
doors to deliverance, or becomes desirous of contemplating them, he should in his mind
form the following aspiration: “For a long time those beings, because they have the notion
of existence, course in the apprehension of a basis.After I have won full enlightenment I
shall demonstrate dharma to those beings so that they may forsake the erroneous views about
a basis.”As a free agent he then enters into the concentrations on emptiness,on the Signless,on
the Wishless.A Bodhisattva who is thus endowed with this thought of enlightenment
and with skill in means does not midway realise the reality-limit. On the contrary, he does
not lose his concentration on friendliness, compassion, sympathetic joy and impartiality.For,
upheld by skill in means, he increases his pure dharmas more and more.His faith, etc.,
becomes keener and keener, and he acquires the powers, the limbs of enlightenment, and
the path.

(377) Moreover, a Bodhisattva reflects that “for a long time those beings, because they perceive
dharmas, course in the apprehension of a basis,”and he develops this aspiration as he
did the former one, entering the concentration on emptiness.

Furthermore, he reflects that by perceiving a sign, those beings have, for a long time, coursed
in the sign, and he deals with this aspiration as before, entering the concentration on
the Signless.

Furthermore, a Bodhisattva reflects: “For a long time have these beings been perverted by the
perceptions of permanence, of happiness, of the self, of loveliness.I will act in such a
way that, after my full enlightenment, I shall demonstrate dharma in order that they may
forsake the perverted views of the perception of permanence, of happiness, of the self, of
loveliness, and in order that they may learn that ‘impermanent is all this, not permanent;ill
is all this, not happiness;without self is all this, not with a self;repulsive is all
this, not lovely.’“Endowed with this thought of enlightenment, (378) and with the previously
described skill in means, taken hold of by perfect wisdom, he does not realize the reality-limit
midway, before all his Buddha-dharmas are complete.He dwells thus, and he has entered
on the concentration on the Wishless,but he does not lose his concentration on friendliness,
etc.For, upheld by skill in means, he increases more and more his pure dharmas.His
faith, etc., becomes keener and keener,and he acquires the powers, the limbs of enlightenment,
and the path.If a Bodhisattva raises the following thought: “These beings also have
for a long time been in the habit of coursing in the apprehension of a basis, and even just
now they do so. They have for a long time been in the habit of coursing in the apprehension
of a basis, and even just now they do so.They have for a long time been in the habit
of coursing in the perception of signs,in perverted views,in perceptions of material objects,in
perceptions of unreal objects,in wrong views, and even now they continue to do so.Thus
will I act that these faults in each and every way may cease to be in them, that they
will be inconceivable in them”;if a Bodhisattva brings all beings to mind in such a way,if
he is endowed with this recollection of all beings, with this production of thought, and
with skill in means, if he is taken hold of by perfect wisdom, and if, endowed with all these
qualities, he thus contemplates the true nature of those deep dharmas - through their
emptiness, or Signlessness, or Wishlessness, or through their being uneffected, unproduced,
without birth,(379) without any positivity - then it is quite impossible that such a Bodhisattva,
who is endowed with such a cognition, could either fall into the Uneffected, or
become intimate with what belongs to the triple world. That cannot possibly be.
