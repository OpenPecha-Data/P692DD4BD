3. The perfection of wisdom comprehends all perfectionsIt is thus that when a Bodhisattva trains
in the perfection of wisdom, (431) all the perfections are automatically incorporated,
taken up, followed afterand included.The view of individuality includes all the sixty-two
views, and even so, for a Bodhisattva who trains in the perfection of wisdom, all the perfections
are included in that.As long as someone’s life-faculty goes on, all the other faculties
are included in it. Even so for a Bodhisattva who trains in perfect wisdom all the
other wholesome dharmas are included in that.When someone’s life-faculty is stopped, all
the other faculties are also stopped. Even so, for a Bodhisattva who trains in perfect wisdom,
all the other unwholesome dharmas are stopped when only non-cognition is stopped, and
all the other perfections are included in that, and automatically taken hold of.
