2. Predominance of perfect wisdom over the other perfectionsHow should a Bodhisattva stand in
the perfection of wisdom, how attend and pay homage to it? The Lord: In every way the perfection
of wisdom should be treated like the Teacher himself.

Sakra then asked Sariputra: Wherefrom, and for what reason has this question of the holy Sariputra
arisen? (172) Sariputra: It arose because I heard it said that “a Bodhisattva who,
taken hold of by perfection of wisdom and skill in means, transform into all-knowledge the
meritorious work founded on jubilation, surpasses the entire meritorious work founded on
giving, morality, patience, vigour, and trance of all the Bodhisattvas who observe a basis.”It
is just the perfection of wisdom which directs the five perfection in their ascent on
the path to all-knowledge.Just as, Kausika, people born blind, one hundred, or one thousand,
or one hundred thousand of them, cannot, without a leader, go along a path and get to
a village, town or city; just so, Giving, Morality, Patience, Vigour and Trance cannot by
themselves be called ‘perfections,’for without the perfection of wisdom they are as if born
blind, without their leaderunable to ascend the path to all-knowledge,and still less can
they reach all-knowledge. When, however, Giving, Morality, Patience, Vigour and Trance are
taken hold of by the perfection of wisdom, then they are termed ‘perfections,’for then (173)
these five perfections acquire an organ of vision which allows them to ascend the path
to all-knowledge, and to reach all-knowledge.
