2. Mara’s deedsFurthermore, Mara, the Evil One, conjures up a vision of the eight great hells,
with many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of Bodhisattvas in them,
and he says to the irreversible Bodhisattva: “Those Bodhisattvas, described by the Tathagata
as irreversible, have been reborn in the great hells.Just so you also, since you have
been described as irreversible, will fall into the great hells.Confess that that thought of
enlightenment was an error! Abandon it!What is Buddhahood to you? In that way you will avoid
rebirth in the hells.If you act thus you will be one who goes to heaven.”If even then
the mind of the Bodhisattva does not waver, is not put out, if he is certain in his knowledge
that an irreversible Bodhisattva cannot possibly be reborn against his will in the hells,then
this is another token of his irreversibility.

Furthermore, Mara, the Evil One, may come along in the guise of a Shramana, and say: “Give up
what you have heard up to now, abandon what you have gained so far!And if you follow this
advice, we will again and again approach you, and say to you:‘What you have heard just now,
that is not the word of the Buddha.It is poetry, the work of poets.But what I here teach
to you, that is the teaching of the Buddha, that is the word of the Buddha.’”If, on hearing
that, a Bodhisattva wavers and is put out, then one should know that he has not been
predicted by the Tathagata,that he is not fixed on full enlightenment,(329) that he does not
stand firmly in the element of irreversibility.But if, even when he has heard these words
of Mara, he does not waver, but flees back to the nature of dharma, to Non-production,
to Non-stopping, to the Uneffected, then he is not one of those who put their trust in others.An
Arhat, a monk whose outflows are dried up, does not go by someone else whom he puts
his trust in, but he has placed the nature of dharma directly before his own eyes,and Mara
has no access to him.Just so an irreversible Bodhisattva cannot be crushed by persons who
belong to the vehicle of the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas,he cannot, by his very nature,
backslide into the level of Disciple or Pratyekabuddha, he is fixed on all-knowledge, and
ends up in perfect enlightenment.It is quite certain that a Bodhisattva who stands firmly
in the element of irreversibility cannot possibly be led astray by others.

Furthermore, someone will come to the irreversible Bodhisattva and say: “A journey in birth-and-death
is this coursing in perfect wisdom, and not the journey of someone who is in quest
of enlightenment.Put and end to all suffering in this very life!You will then no longer
experience all the sufferings and disappointments which are bound up with the plane of birth-and-death.Aye
surely, in this very life already will this personality of yours be finished,
why do you think of taking upon yourself another one [for the sake of other beings]?”If
even then the Bodhisattva neither wavers nor is put out, then Mara himself will say to
him: “Just have a look at those Bodhisattvas who for countless aeons have presented the necessities
of life (330) to the Buddhas, the Lords, who have led holy lives in the presence
of countless Buddhas, who have honoured countless Buddhas and Lords, have questioned them
about just this vehicle of the Bodhisattvas, have asked them how a Bodhisattva should stand,
have heard the answer of the Tathagatas, and have acted on it!In spite of the fact that
they have stood, coursed and exerted themselves as they should, - to this very day they
have not yet known full enlightenment!They stand firm in their instructions, they train themselves
as they should, - but they have not reached all-knowledge!How then will you reach
full enlightenment ever?” If even then he does not waver and is not put out, then Mara,
the Evil One, will conjure up some monks in that place, and say: “Those monks have become
Arhats, with their outflows dried up. They who have set out for enlightenment, in the meantime
have reached Arhatship, and become established in it.How will you ever reach full enlightenment?”
It is quite certain that a Bodhisattva must be irreversible from full enlightenment
if, when this is being said and expounded, his mind does not waver and is not put out.If
the mind of a Bodhisattva who has heard from a stranger these discouraging remarks is
not excluded from the true nature of dharma, if he does not go back on it, if he does not
change his mind, if he recognizes those deeds of Mara for what they are, then it is quite
impossible that he who courses correctly in the perfections should not reach all-knowledge.
Mara, the Evil One, cannot possibly gain entry to a Bodhisattva who not only courses but
also trains himself correctly, who does not lack in the practices described by the Tathagatas,
who is completely adjusted to this mental activity which is associated with the perfections.(331)
If a Bodhisattva recognizes the deeds of Mara, if, when he hears discouraging
remarks from strangers, he does not desist, nor slide back, nor change his mind, if he
perceives those deeds of Mara for what they are,then this is another token of irreversibility.

Furthermore, an irreversible Bodhisattva does not piece together a perception of form, etc.,
nor produce one.For the irreversible Bodhisattva who has through dharmas which are empty
of their own marks definitely entered on the certainty that he will win salvation as a Bodhisattvadoes
not apprehend even that dharma, and so he cannot piece it together, or produce
it.One says therefore that “a Bodhisattva is irreversible if he patiently accepts the cognition
of non-production.”This is another token of irreversibility.

Furthermore, Mara, the Evil One, comes along in the guise of a monk and tries to deter the Bodhisattva
with the words: “The same as space is this all-knowledge.It is a dharma which is
not,it is non-existent.Who can anoint himself for it, who fully know it? There is no one
who could go forth to it, there is no one who could fully know it, nothing that should be
fully known, there is no one who would understand, there is nothing that should be understood.At
all times those dharmas are the same as space,it is useless for you to resist,revealed
as a deed of Mara is this doctrine that ‘one should know full enlightenment,’ it is not
the Buddha’s teaching.”A son or daughter of good family should then cognize, realize and
know that (332) this kind of critical examination is just a deed of Mara.After he has made
this reflection, he should make his mind firm, unshakeable, irrestible.This is another
token of irreversibility.
