6. AttainmentSubhuti: Through the Buddha’s might, O Lord.Moreover, O Lord, a Bodhisattva [who
sets out on his journey] does not approach [the goal of full Bodhisattvahood] from where
it begins, nor where it ends, nor in the middle either.Because a Bodhisattva is as boundless
as form, etc., is boundless.He does not approach the idea that ‘a Bodhisattva is form,’
etc.That also does not exist, and is not apprehended.Thus in each and every way I do not
get at any of the dharmas which constitute a Bodhisattva. I do not see that dharma which
the word ‘Bodhisattva’ denotes.Perfect wisdom also I neither see nor get at.All-knowledge
also I neither see nor get at.Since in each and every way I neither apprehend nor see that
dharma, - what dharma should I instruct and admonish through what dharma in what dharma?
‘Buddha,’ Bodhisattva,’ ‘perfect wisdom,’ all these are mere words.And what they denote is
something uncreated.It is as with the self.(26) Although we speak of a ‘self,’ yet absolutely
the self is something uncreated. Since therefore all dharmas are without own-being, what
is that form, etc., which cannot be seized, and which is something uncreated? Thus the
fact that all dharmas are without own-being is the same as the fact that they are uncreated.But
the non-creation of all dharmas differs from those dharmas [themselves].How shall I
instruct and admonish a non-creation in a perfect wisdom which is also a non-creation? And
yet, one cannot apprehend as other than uncreated all the dharmas, be they those which constitute
a Buddha, or a Bodhisattva, or him who marches to enlightenment.If a Bodhisattva,
when this is being taught, is not afraid, then one should know that ‘this Bodhisattva, this
great being, courses in perfect wisdom, develops it, investigates it, and meditates on
it.’Because at the time a Bodhisattva investigates these dharmas in perfect wisdom, at that
time he does not approach form, etc., nor go to it. Nor does he review the production of
form, etc., nor its stopping.For the non-production of form, etc., is not form, etc.(27)
The non-passing-away of form, etc., is not form, etc.Non-production and form are therefore
not two, nor divided. Not-passing-away and form, etc., are therefore not two, nor divided.Inasmuch
as one calls it ‘form,’ etc., one makes a count of what is not two.Thus the Bodhisattva
investigates in perfect wisdom all dharmas in all their modes, and at that time he
does (28) not approach form, etc.

Sariputra: As I understand the teaching of the Venerable Subhuti, a Bodhisattva also is a non-production.But
if a Bodhisattva is a non-production, how then does he go on the difficult
pilgrimage, and how can he possibly endure the experience of those sufferings [which he
is said to undergo] for the sake of beings? Subhuti: I do not look for a Bodhisattva who goes
on the difficult pilgrimage. In any case, one who courses in the perception of difficulties
is not a Bodhisattva.Because one who has generated a perception of difficulties is unable
to work the weal of countless beings.On the contrary, he forms the notion of ease,he
forms the notion that all beings, whether men or women, are his parents and children,and
thus he goes on the pilgrimage of a Bodhisattva.A Bodhisattva should therefore identify all
beings with his parents or children, yes, even with his own self,like this: ‘As I myself
want to be quite free from all sufferings, just so all beings want to be quite free from
all sufferings.’In addition with regard to all beings one should form the notion: ‘I ought
not to desert all these beings.I ought to set them free from the quite measureless heap of
sufferings!And I should not produce towards them a thought of hate, even though I might
be dismembered a hundred times!’It is thus that a Bodhisattva should lift up his heart. When
he dwells as one whose heart is such, then he will neither course nor dwell as one who
perceives difficulties.(29) And further a Bodhisattva should produce the thought that ‘as
in each and every way a self does not exist, and is not got at, so in each and every way all
dharmas do not exist, and are not got at.’He should apply this notion to all dharmas, inside
and outside.When he dwells as one whose heart is such, then he will neither course,
nor dwell, as one who perceives difficulties.But when the Venerable Sariputra said that ‘a
non-production is the Bodhisattva,’indeed, it is so,‘a non-production is the Bodhisattva.’

Sariputra: Further, is just a Bodhisattva a non-production, or the dharmas also which constitute
him? Subhuti: The dharmas which constitute a Bodhisattva are also a non-production. Sariputra:
Are just the dharmas which constitute a Bodhisattva a non-production, or also the
state of all-knowledge? Subhuti: The state of all-knowledge is also a non-production.Sariputra:
Is just the state of all-knowledge a non-production, or also the dharmas which constitute
it? Subhuti: The dharmas which constitute all-knowledge are also a non-production.Sariputra:
Are just the dharmas which constitute all-knowledge a non-production, or also the
common people? Subhuti: The common people are also a non-production.Sariputra: Are just
the common people a non-production, or also the dharmas which constitute them? Subhuti: The
dharmas which constitute the common people are also a non-production.(30) Sariputra: If,
venerable Subhuti, the Bodhisattva is a non-production and also the dharmas which constitute
him, and also the state of all-knowledge, and also the dharmas which constitute it, and
also the common people, and also the dharmas which constitute them, - then, surely, the
state of all-knowledge is reached by a Bodhisattva without any exertion?Subhuti: I do not
wish for the attainment of an unproduced dharma, nor for reunion with one.Further, does one
attain an unproduced attainment through an unproduced dharma? Sariputra: Is then an unproduced
attainment attained through an unproduced dharma, or through a produced dharma? Subhuti:
Is then an unproduced dharma produced, or is it unproduced? Sariputra: Is then production
a dharma which is a non-production, or is non-production a dharma which is production?
Subhuti: To talk of a production-dharma as a non-production-dharma is not intelligible.Sariputra:
To talk of non-production is also not intelligible.Subhuti: Non-production is
just talk.Non-production just appears before the mind’s eye.Non-production is just a flash
in the mind.Absolutely it is nothing more than that.

Sariputra: In the first rank of the preachers of dharma should the Venerable Subhuti be placed.(31)
For in whatever way he may be questioned, he finds a way out; he does not swerve from
[the correct teaching about] the true nature of Dharma, and he does not contradict that
true nature of Dharma.Subhuti: This is the Lord’s Absolute, the essence of the Disciples
who are without any support,so that, in whatever way they are questioned, they find a way
out, do not contradict the true nature of dharmas, nor depart from it.And that because they
do not rely on any dharmas.Sariputra: Well said, Subhuti.And what is that perfection of
the Bodhisattvas which [allows them not to] lean on any dharmas? Subhuti: The perfection
of wisdom, beneficial to all the [three] vehicles, is also the perfection which [allows them
not to] lean on any dharma, because [it shows that] all dharmas have no support [and can
therefore give none].For if a Bodhisattva, when this deep perfection of wisdom is being
taught, remains unafraid, then one should know that he has adjusted himself to the perfection
of wisdom, and that he is not lacking in this attention [to the true facts about dharmas].

Sariputra: How is it that a Bodhisattva does not lack in attention when he is adjusted to perfect
wisdom? (32) For if a Bodhisattva is not lacking in attention, then he should [automatically]
lack in adjustment to the perfection of wisdom.And if he does not lack in adjustment
to the perfection of wisdom, then he would be lacking in attention.But if [in] a Bodhisattva
the two facts that he is not lacking in attention, and that he is not lacking in dwelling
in the perfection of wisdom, belong together,then all beings also will not be lacking
in dwelling in the perfection of wisdom.Because they also dwell not lacking in attention.

Subhuti: Well said,and yet I must reprove you,although the Venerable Sariputra has taken hold
of the matter correctly as far as the words are concerned.Because one should know that attention
is without own-being in the same way in which beings are without own-being;that attention
has no real existence in the same way in which beings have no real existence;that
attention is isolated in the same way in which beings are isolated;that attention is unthinkable
in the same way in which beings are unthinkable;that acts of mental attention do not
undergo the process which leads to enlightenment in the same way in which beings do not
undergo that process;that acts of attention do not in any real sense undergo the process
which leads to enlightenment, any more than beings do.It is through an attention of such a
character that I wish that a Bodhisattva, a great being, may dwell in this dwelling.
