2. The perfection of wisdom and the sutras of the disciplesIn addition, persons who belong to
the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas may give up and abandon this perfection of wisdom which
nourishes the cognition of the all-knowing, and decide to look for Sutras which do not nourish
it.Furthermore, those do not train themselves in this perfection of wisdom who do not
want to train in worldly and supramundane spiritual dharmas, nor to go forth to them.(234)
As they do not train in perfect wisdom, they cannot go forth to worldly and supramundane
spiritual dharmas.Those people of limited intelligence get rid of and abandon the perfection
of wisdom, which is the root of the comprehension of worldly and supramundane spiritual
dharmas, as they really are, and instead decide to look for support in what are mere branches.Just
as if a dog would spurn a morsel of food given to him by his master, and prefer
to take a mouthful of water from a servant; just so, in the future, some persons belonging
to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas will spurn this perfection of wisdom, which is the root
of the cognition of the all-knowing, and decide to look for the core, for growth, for Buddhahood,
in the vehicle of the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas, which really corresponds to
branches, leaves and foliage.This also should be known as done to them by Mara.For those
people of small intelligence will not cognize that the perfection of wisdom alone nourishes
the cognition of the all-knowing.They get rid of, abandon and spurn the perfection of wisdom,
and decide to study, as superior to it, other Sutras, those which welcome the level
of a Disciple or Pratyekabuddha.They should be compared to branches, leaves and foliage.For
a Bodhisattva should not train in the same way in which persons belonging to the vehicle
of the Disciples or Pratyekabuddhas are trained.How then are the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas
trained? They make up their minds that “one single self we shall tame, one single self
we shall pacify, one single self we shall lead to final Nirvana.” Thus they undertake
exercises which are intended to bring about wholesome roots for the sake of taming themselves,
pacifying themselves, leading themselves to Nirvana.A Bodhisattva should certainly not
in such way train himself.On the contrary, he should train himself thus: (235) “My own self
I will place in Suchness, and, so that all the world might be helped, I will place all
beings into Suchness, and I will lead to Nirvana the whole immeasurable world of beings.”With
that intention should a Bodhisattva undertake all the exercises which bring about all
the wholesome roots. But he should not boast about them.Imagine a man who, unable to see
an elephant, would try to determine his colour and shape.In the darkness he would touchand
examine the foot of the elephant,and decide that the colour and shape of the elephant should
be inferred from his foot.Would that be an intelligent thing to do? Subhuti: No, Lord!The
Lord: The same is true of those persons who belong to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas,
who do not understand this perfection of wisdom and ask no questions about it, but, while
desirous of full enlightenment, spurn it and prefer to look for the Sutras which welcome
the level of a Disciple or of a Pratyekabuddha.Also this has been done to them by Mara.Just
as if a person who desires jewels would not look for them in the great ocean,but in a puddle
in a cow’s footprint,and would thus in effect equate the great ocean with the water in
a cow’s footprint.Would he be a very intelligent person? Subhuti: No, Lord!The Lord: The
same applies to persons who belong to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas if, though they have
got this perfection of wisdom, they nevertheless cut themselves off from it, (236) without
plunging or probing into it.And who prefer the Sutras which welcome the level of Disciples
or Pratyekabuddhas, through advocating a dwelling in unconcerned inactivity,and which
do not recommend the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas, but only the taming, appeasing, Nirvana
of one single self.The decision to win seclusion, to win the fruits of a holy life, from the
fruit of a Streamwinner to Pratyekabuddhahood, to enter Parinirvana after one has, in this
very life, freed thought, without further clinging, from the outflows,- that means to
be “associated with the level of a Disciple or Pratyekabuddha.”Not to that should Bodhisattvas
raise their thoughts.For when they have set out in the great vehicle Bodhisattvas put
on the great armour.Their thoughts should not be raised to any unconcernedness whatsoever.For
they are real men, leaders of the world, promoters of the world’s weal.Therefore they
should constantly and always be trained in the six perfections.But those persons who belong
to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas, and who, without knowing and understanding the Sutras
associated with the six perfections, spurn this perfection of wisdom, and prefer the Sutras
which welcome the level of Disciple or Pratyekabuddha, - their wholesome root is immature,
their intelligence limited and poor, their resoluteness but weak.They resemble a mason,
or mason’s apprentice, who would want to build a palace of the size of the Vaijayanta
palace,and who would take its measure from measuring the car of sun or moon.(237) A similar
procedure is adopted by those who reject the perfection of wisdom and try to find all-knowledge
through Sutras associated with the level of Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas, Sutras
which recommend the taming, appeasing, and Nirvana of nothing more than one self only.If they
would look for such Sutras and train with this intention,would these Bodhisattvas be very
intelligent? Subhuti: No, Lord!The Lord: This also has been done to them by Mara.Suppose
a person who first sees the universal monarch, and determines from the signs of what he
sees his complexion, shape, beauty and majesty.He would then do the same with the commander
of a fort.If he were unable to make a distinction, if he were to say to the commander of
a fort, “just like that is the universal monarch in complexion, shape, beauty and majesty,”
(238) if he would, in other words, equate a universal monarch with the commander of a
fort,would that be an intelligent thing to do? Subhuti: No, Lord!The Lord: The same applies
to persons who belong to the Bodhisattva-vehicle and who in the future will reject this
perfection of wisdom, and seek for all-knowledge through sutras associated with the level
of Disciple or Pratyekabuddha.This also has been done to them by Mara.On the contrary, I certainly
do not say that Bodhisattvas should seek for all-knowledge through the Sutras associated
with the level of Disciple or Pratyekabuddha.Bodhisattvas can certainly not go forth
to supreme enlightenment unless they are trained in what the Tathagata has announced in
the perfection of wisdom as the skill in means of a Bodhisattva.For the full knowledge of
a Bodhisattva is stupid in other Sutras.Therefore then, Subhuti, the Tathagata, seeing this
advantage in the perfection of wisdom, by manifold methods shows it to the Bodhisattvas,
instigates and introduces to it, fills them with enthusiasm about it, makes them rejoice
at it, entrusts them with it, in the hope that thus the Bodhisattva may become irreversible
to full enlightenment.Subhuti, do those Bodhisattvas appear to be very intelligent who,
having obtained and met with the irreversible, the great vehicle, will again abandon it,
turn away from it, and prefer an inferior vehicle? Subhuti: No, Lord! (239,1)The Lord: If
a starving man would refuse superior and excellent food, and prefer to eat inferior and stale
food,would he be very intelligent? Subhuti: No, Lord!The Lord: Just so, Subhuti, in the
future some Bodhisattvas will refuse this perfection of wisdom, will prefer the Sutras associated
with the level of Disciple or Pratyekabuddha, and will seek for all-knowledge through
the Sutras which welcome the level of Disciple or Pratyekabuddha.Would these Bodhisattvas
be very intelligent? Subhuti: No, Lord!The Lord: Also this has been done to them by
Mara.A man who had got a priceless gem and who considered it equal to a gem of inferior value
and quality,would he be an intelligent person? Subhuti: No, Lord! (240,1)The Lord: Just
so there will be in the future some persons belonging to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas
who, though they have got this deep and brightly shining gem of perfect wisdom, will nevertheless
think that it should be considered equal with the vehicle of Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas,
and will decide to seek for all-knowledge and for skill in means on the level of
Disciple or Pratyekabuddha.Would they be very intelligent? Subhuti: No, Lord!The Lord: This
also has been done to them by Mara.
