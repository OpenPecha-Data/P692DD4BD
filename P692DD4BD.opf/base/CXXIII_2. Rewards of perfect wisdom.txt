2. Rewards of perfect wisdomAnd the four Great Kings, the World Guardians, will come to the
Bodhisattva who trains in this way in the perfection of wisdom, and they will say to him:
“Train yourself quickly in this course of a Bodhisattva, son of good family! Nimbly train
yourself!Here are the four begging bowls which you shall receive when you are seated on the
terrace of enlightenment, as one who then has won full enlightenment.”Not only the four
World Guardians will come to the Bodhisattva who trains in perfect wisdom as it has been expounded,
but I also, not to mention the other Gods.Constantly also the Tathagatas will bring
him to mind.All the worldly ills that might befall the Bodhisattva who courses in perfect
wisdom, such as attacks from others, etc., shall be prevented from affecting him in any
way.This also, O Lord, is a quality which a Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom gains
in this very life.

Ananda thereupon thought: Is this speech of Sakra, Chief of Gods, due to his own insight, or
to the Buddha’s might? Sakra, through the Buddha’s might, read his thoughts, and said: To
the Buddha’s might, Ananda, to the Buddha’s sustaining power should this be attributed. For
I myself (415) am quite incapable of uttering anything relevant on the subject of Bodhisattvas.The
Lord: So it is, Ananda.What Sakra, Chief of Gods, has said was due to the Tathagata’s
might, to his sustaining power.
