2. Spiritual rebirth resulting from this knowledgeWhen this doctrine of unthinkability, etc.,
was being taught, the minds of five hundred monks were freed, without further clinging,
from the outflows, and so were the minds of two thousand nuns. Six thousand lay brethren and
three thousand lay sisters obtained the pure, dispassionate, unstained eye of dharma. Twenty
thousand Bodhisattvas won the patient acceptance of dharmas which fail to be produced.And
the Lord has predicted that they shall win enlightenment in this very Bhadrakalpa.And
as to the lay brethren and lay sisters, whose dharma-eye was purified, they also have been
predestined by the Lord,and they also will be freed, without further clinging, from the
outflows. (281,1)
