1. Deep stationsSubhuti: It is wonderful, O Lord, with how great, with what unlimited, and measureless
qualities a Bodhisattva is endowed!The Lord: So it is, Subhuti.For an irreversible
Bodhisattva has gained a cognition which is endless and boundless, and to which Disciples
and Pratyekabuddhas have no claim.

Subhuti: For aeons on end the Lord could go on expounding the attributes, tokens and signs of
an irreversible Bodhisattva.Hence he now might indicate the very deep positions of a Bodhisattva
which are connected with perfect wisdom.The Lord: Well said, Subhuti. You obviously
bring up the very deep positions because you want me to change the subject.“Deep,” Subhuti,
of Emptiness that is a synonym,of the Signless, the Wishless, the Uneffected, the Unproduced,
of No-birth, Non-existence, Dispassion, Cessation, Nirvana and Departing.

(342) Subhuti: Is it a synonym only of these, or of all dharmas? The Lord: It is a synonym of
all dharmas.For form, etc., is deep.How is form, etc., deep? As deep as Suchness, so deep
is form, etc.As deep as the Suchness of form, etc., so deep is form, etc.Where there is
no form, etc., that is the depth of form, etc.

Subhuti: It is wonderful, O Lord, how a subtle device has opened up [or: impeded] form, etc.,
and indicated Nirvana at the same time.
