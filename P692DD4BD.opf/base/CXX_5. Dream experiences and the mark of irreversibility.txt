5. Dream experiences and the mark of irreversibilityFurthermore, if a Bodhisattva even in his
dreams beholds that “all dharmas are like a dream,” but does not realize [that experience,
regarding it as final] then also that should be known as the irreversible mark of an irreversible
Bodhisattva.

It is another mark if, even in his dreams, neither the level of Disciple or Pratyekabuddha,
nor anything that belongs to the triple world, becomes an object of his longing, or appears
advantageous to him.

It is another mark if, even in his dreams, he sees himself as a Tathagata, - in the middle of
an assembly of many hundreds of thousands of niyutas of kotis of persons, (381) seated in
a circular hall with a peaked roof, surrounded by a community of monks, revered by the community
of Bodhisattvas, demonstrating dharma.

It is another mark, if, even in his dreams, he rises into the air and demonstrates dharma to
beings, if he perceives the halo round the Buddha, if he conjures up monks who go into the
different directions to fulfil the functions of Buddhas in other world systems and demonstrate
dharma there.Even when he dreams he has such perceptions.

It is another mark if, when he dreams, he remains unafraidwhen a village, town, city, or kingdom
is sacked; or when he sees a huge conflagration spreading; or when he sees wild beasts
or other offensive animals; or when his head is about to be cut off, or when he is subjected
to other great fears and terrors, and when he sees the fears and terrors to which other
beings are subjected. In no case do fear and terror arise in him, and he remains unafraid.And
immediately after he has woken up from his dream, he reflects that “like a dream is
all this which belongs to the triple world.And in that sense should I demonstrate dharmas
after I have won enlightenment, as one who demonstrates dharma correctly.”

It is again another mark of irreversibility if a Bodhisattva, on seeing in his dreams (382)
the beings that are in the hells, reflects that “Thus will I act that in my Buddha-field,
after I have won full enlightenment, there shall be no states of woe at all!”This also should
be known as a mark which shows that an irreversible Bodhisattva has become so pure that
he can never again be reborn [against his will] in the states of woe.

And how could one know that there would be no states of woe in the Buddha-field of that Bodhisattva?
If a Bodhisattva, on seeing in his dreams the beings reborn in the hells, as animals,
or as Pretas, sets up mindfulnessand determines to bring about a Buddha-field without
such states of woe,then that should be known as the mark which shows that he has become so
pure that he can never again be reborn in the states of woe.

Furthermore, a Bodhisattva may dream [a prophetic dream] to the effect that a town or village
is on fire. After he has woken up, he considers thus: “I have the attributes, tokens and
signs which I have seen, in my dream, as the attributes, tokens and signs by which an irreversible
Bodhisattva should be borne in mind.Because of this Truth, because of my utterance
of this Truth, let this town fire or village fire, which is taking place there, be appeased,
cooled, extinguished.”If that fire is then extinguished, one should know (383) that
that Bodhisattva has been predicted to full enlightenment by the Tathagatas in the past;if
it is not extinguished, one should know that he has not been so predicted.If again, Subhuti,
instead of being appeased, this conflagration passes beyond all bounds and spreads from
house to house, from road to road, then one should know that this Bodhisattva has in the
past collected karma consisting in the refusal of dharma, conducive to weakness in wisdom.From
that results the karma of his which led him to this experience in his present life [i.e.
to his distress at being unable to control that fire],which is just a result of karma
left over from his refusal of dharma [in the past].For, as you know, a Bodhisattva’s past
lives condition the [absence or presence of the] mark of irreversibility later on.A Bodhisattva
who succeeds in controlling the fire should, on the other hand, be borne in mind as
irreversible from full enlightenment.
