3. Perfect wisdom and skill in meansSariputra knew that the thoughts of those Bodhisattvas were
freed from the outflows, without any further clinging, and he asked the Lord for the reason,
or cause, of that. The Lord: Those Bodhisattvas have honoured five hundred Buddhas,
and during all that time they have given gifts, guarded their morality, perfected their patience,
exerted their vigour, and produced trance.But they were not upheld by perfect wisdom
and lacked in skill in means.And so, although they had gained the path of emptiness, had
coursed in the Signless, had put their minds to work on the Wishless, as wanting skill
in means they had realised the reality limit, and come forth on the level of Disciple or Pratyekabuddha,
and not on the level of a Buddha.Suppose there is a very huge bird, one hundred,
or up to five hundred miles large, but without any wings, or with crippled or damaged
wings.That bird would want to fly down to Jambudvipa from the Heaven of the Gods of the
Thirty-three.If in the intermediate space, in the middle of its journey (311) to Jambudvipa,
it would want to return to the Gods of the Thirty-three,would it be able to do so? Sariputra:
No, Lord.The Lord: And could it hope to come down on Jambudvipa without damage or injury?
Sariputra: No, Lord.It is bound to get damaged and injured, and when it drops down
on Jambudvipa it will incur death or deadly pain.Because of the fact that, whereas its body
is huge, the strength of its wings is insufficient, and it just drops down from above.

The Lord: So it is, Sariputra.Even if a Bodhisattva, after he has raised his mind to full enlightenment,
would, for countless aeons, give gifts, guard his morality, perfect his patience,
exert his vigour, and enter the trances, how ever great may be his setting forth and
the thought which he raises to full enlightenment,- if he is not upheld by perfect wisdom
and lacks in skill in means, he is bound to fall on the level of Disciple or Pratyekabuddha.

Furthermore, Sariputra, it may be that a Bodhisattva brings to mind, and retains in his mind,
(312) of the Buddhas and Lords, past, future and present, the morality, the concentration,
the wisdom, the emancipation, the vision and cognition of emancipation, - but all that
after the manner of a sign.He then neither knows nor sees the morality of the Tathagatas,
nor their concentration, or wisdom, or emancipation, or their vision and cognition of emancipation.Ignorant
of them, blind to them, he hears the word ‘emptiness,’treats that as a sign,and
wishes to covert [that mass of merit] into a full enlightenment [which he regards
as emptiness].In consequence he will remain on the level of a Disciple or Pratyekabuddha,-
because of the fact that he is not upheld by perfect wisdom, that he lacks in skill in means.

Sariputra: As I understand the meaning of the Lord’s teaching, although a Bodhisattva may be
joined to a huge equipment of merit, as long as he is not upheld by perfect wisdom and is
without skill in means, he lacks the good friend, and his attainment of full enlightenment
is uncertain.A Bodhisattva who wants to win full enlightenment should therefore develop
the perfection of wisdom, and become skilled in means.The Lord: So it is, Sariputra.

(313) Sakra and the Gods: Deep, O Lord, is perfect wisdom! Hard to win, exceedingly hard to
win is full enlightenment!The Lord: So it is, O Gods.Deep is this perfection of wisdom.Hard
to win, exceedingly hard to win is full enlightenment,if one is weak in wisdom, below the
mark in vigour and resolve, unskilled in means, and if one serves the bad friends.
