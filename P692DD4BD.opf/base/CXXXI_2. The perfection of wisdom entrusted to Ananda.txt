2. The perfection of wisdom entrusted to AnandaThe Lord thereupon said to the Venerable Ananda:
In this manner also should you know this perfection of wisdom as the one who nurses the
cognition of the all-knowing in the Bodhisattvas.Therefore then, Ananda, a Bodhisattva who
wants to acquire the cognition of the all-knowing should course in this perfection of wisdom,
(528,1)hear it, take it up, study, spread, repeat and write it.When, through the Tathagata’s
sustaining power it has been well written, in very distinct letters, in a great
book, one should honour, revere, adore and worship it, with flowers, incense, scents, wreaths,
unguents, aromatic powders, strips of cloth, parasols, banners, bells, flags and with
rows of lamps all round, and with manifold kinds of worship.This is our admonition to you,
Ananda.For in this perfection of wisdom the cognition of the all-knowing will be brought
to perfection.What do you think, Ananda, is the Tathagata your teacher? Ananda: He is, O
Lord.The Lord: The Tathagata is your teacher, Ananda.You have ministered to me, Ananda, with
friendly acts of body, acts of speech, acts of mind.Therefore then, Ananda, just as you
have given affection, faith and respect to me as I am at present in this incarnation, just
so, Ananda, should you act after my decease towards this perfection of wisdom.For the second
time, for the third time, I entrust and transmit to you this perfection of wisdom, so
that it may not disappear. No other man would be as suitable as you are.(529) As long as
this perfection of wisdom shall be observed in the world, one can be sure that “for so long
does the Tathagata abide in it,”that “for so long does the Tathagata demonstrate dharma,”and
that the beings in it are not lacking in the vision of the Buddha, the hearing of the
dharma, the attendance of the Samgha.One should know that those beings are living in the
presence of the Tathagata who will hear this perfection of wisdom, take it up, study, spread,
repeat and write it, and who will honour, revere, adore and worship it.

Thus spoke the Lord.Enraptured, the Bodhisattvas, headed by Maitreya, and the Venerable Subhuti,
and the Venerable Ananda, and Sakra, Chief of Gods, and the entire world with its Gods,
men, Asuras, Garudas and Gandharvas delighted in the Lord’s teaching.
