4. Sources of discord between teacher and pupilThen again there are the deeds of Mara which
wreck the chances of cooperation between teacher and pupil. First of all, it may be that the
pupil is zealous, and desires to learn perfect wisdom, but that the teacher is indolent,
and has no desire to demonstrate dharma.Or, the teacher may be untiring, and desire to give
perfect wisdom, while the pupil is tired or too busy.Secondly, it may be that the pupil
is zealous, and desires to learn the perfection of wisdom, to bear it in mind, preach, study,
spread, or merely to write it, that he is clever, intelligent and has a good memory;but
the teacher may move into a different district, or he may be unacquainted with the main
points, unacquainted with the details, without the higher knowledge.(244) Or, the teacher
may be untiring, in possession of the higher knowledge, willing to give and preach this
perfection of wisdom; but the pupil has set out for another district, or in unacquainted with
the main points, unacquainted with the details, without the higher knowledge.Further,
the teacher may be a person who attaches weight to fleshly things, to gain, honour and robes,while
the pupil is a man of few wishes, easily contented, and quite detached. Or he may
be a person who is unwilling to give away anything of value.This also would cause discord,
when it is a question of training in perfect wisdom, or of copying it.On the other hand,
a pupil may be full of faith, desirous of hearing this perfection of wisdom and of understanding
its meaning, liberal and generous;but the teacher has no faith, is too easily satisfied,
and does not desire to teach.Or, the pupil may be full of faith, and desire to hear
and to understand the meaning;but it may be that the teacher, because some obstacle hinders
his access to dharma, does not have these Sutras at his disposal, and cannot fathom them;a
pupil would obviously be out of touch with a teacher who has not attained them.(245) Or
again, a teacher may desire to teach,when a pupil is not zealous to hear.Further, it may
be that the pupil does not want to listen because he is weighed down by sloth, weighed down
by bodily fatigue,but the teacher is willing to teach;conversely, a teacher may, although
the pupil will want to listen, not desire to teach because he is weighed down by sloth
or physical fatigue.This discord will also make writing, preaching and study difficult.
