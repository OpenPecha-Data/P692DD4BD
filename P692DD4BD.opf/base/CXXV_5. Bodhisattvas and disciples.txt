5. Bodhisattvas and disciplesSubhuti: Is then a Bodhisattva also trained in the accomplishment
of a Disciple? The Lord: He should also be trained in that.But he does not train with the
intention of always continuing with the accomplishment of a Disciple, or with the idea
of making it in any way his own. (433) Not thus does he train.He also knows the qualities
of the Disciples, but does not abide with them.He assimilates them, without opposing them.
He trains with the intention that he should demonstrate and reveal also the virtues of the
Disciples.When he trains thus, a Bodhisattva arrives at a condition where he is worthy of
receiving gifts from the world with its Gods, men and Asuras.He surpasses all other people
who are worthy of gifts, associated with Disciples or Pratyekabuddhas. And all-knowledge
will be near to him.When he trains thus, a Bodhisattva does not part from the perfection
of wisdom, but he courses in it, is not lacking in the dwelling of the perfection of wisdom.When
he courses thus a Bodhisattva should be known as “unfailing, definitely unfailing”with
regard to all-knowledge, and he keeps away from the level of a Disciple or Pratyekabuddha.
He is near to full enlightenment.If, however, it occurs to him that “this is the perfection
of wisdom which brings this all-knowledge,” - then one who has such a notion does
not course in the perfection of wisdom.On the contrary he has no notion even of perfect wisdom,
he does not perceive or review that “this is the perfection of wisdom,” or “his is the
perfection of wisdom,” or “it shall feed all-knowledge.”If he courses thus, a Bodhisattva
courses in the perfection of wisdom.
