1. Pride and the magical power of veracityThe Bodhisattva, as we saw, has said: “I have been
predicted to full enlightenment by the Tathagatas of the past. Because that is the Truth,
because of my utterance of that Truth, let that ghost depart!”Mara in his turn tries, at
that time, to induce the ghost to depart.And his efforts will be particularly strong and energetic
when he has to deal with a Bodhisattva who has but recently set out in the vehicle.It
will then be the magical power of Mara which has driven the ghost away.But the Bodhisattva
thinks that it was his might which drove him away,and he does not know that it was Mara’s
might.He will then slacken in his efforts.But as a result of his [apparent] victory
over the ghost he thinks that he has had his prediction in the past, and he despises other
Bodhisattvas, sneers at them, ironically compliments, contemns and deprecates them.His pride
will go on increasing, will become quite firm and rigid.That pride, arrogance, hauteur,
false pride, conceit keep him away from all-knowledge, from the supreme cognition of a Buddha,
from the cognition of the Self-Existent, (386,1), from the cognition of the all-knowing,from
supreme enlightenment.When he meets with Bodhisattvas who could be his good friends,
- virtuous in character, resolutely intent on the sublime, earnestly intent, skilled
in means, endowed with the irreversible dharma, - in his conceit he despises them, does not
tend, love and honour them.So he will tighten the bond of Mara still further.One would expect
him to belong to one of the two levels, either that of a Disciple, or that of a Pratyekabuddha.In
this way, in connection with the magical power of the enunciation of a Truth,
Mara the Evil One may cause an obstacle to full enlightenment in a Bodhisattva who has but
recently set out in the vehicle, who has little faith, has learned little, lacks in the
good friend, is not upheld by perfect wisdom, and lacks in skill in means.This also should
be known as Mara’s deed to a Bodhisattva.
