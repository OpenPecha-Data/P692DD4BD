5. No growth or diminutionSubhuti: Can something have growth, or diminution, if it is beyond
all distinctive words? The Lord: No, Subhuti.Subhuti: But if there is no growth or diminution
of an entity which is beyond all distinctive words, then there can be no growth or diminution
of the six perfections.And how then could a Bodhisattva win full enlightenment through
the force of these six perfections, if they do not grow, and how could he come close
to full enlightenment, since, without fulfilling the perfections, he cannot come close to
full enlightenment?(349) The Lord: So it is, Subhuti.There is certainly no growth or diminution
of a perfection-entity.A Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom, who develops perfect
wisdom, and who is skilled in means, does obviously not think that “this perfection
of giving grows, this perfection of giving diminishes.”But he knows that “this perfection
of giving is a mere word.”When he gives a gift he turns over to full enlightenment the mental
activities, the productions of thought, the roots of good which are involved in that act
of giving.But he turns them over in such a way that he respects the actual reality of full
enlightenment.

And he proceeds in the same way when he takes upon himself the moral obligations,

when he perfects himself in patience,

(350) when he exerts vigour,

enters into the trances,

courses in perfect wisdom, develops perfect wisdom.

Subhuti: What then is this supreme enlightenment? (351) The Lord: It is Suchness.But Suchness
neither grows nor diminishes.A Bodhisattva who repeatedly and often dwells in mental activities
connected with that Suchness comes near to the supreme enlightenment, and he does
not lose those mental activities again.It is certain that there can be no growth or diminution
of an entity which is beyond all words,and that therefore neither the perfections,nor
all dharmas, can grow or diminish.It is thus that, when he dwells in mental activities of
this kind, a Bodhisattva becomes one who is near to perfect enlightenment.
