1. Prediction of AvakirnakusumaThereupon, at that time, one of the Gods of the Thirty-three
seized Mandarava flowers, magnificent Mandarava flowers, and came to where the Lord was.And
just at that time, six thousand monks were assembled and seated in that assembly.They rose
from their seats, put their upper robes over one shoulder, placed their right knees on
the earth, and saluted the Lord with their folded hands.Through the Buddha’s might their hands
were then filled with Mandarava flowers, with magnificent Mandarava flowers.They scattered
those flowers over the Lord, and said: “We, O Lord, shall course in this perfection
of wisdom! We, O Lord, shall dwell in the supreme dwelling of perfect wisdom!”

Thereupon, on that occasion, the Lord smiled.But such is the nature of the Buddhas and Lords
that, when they manifest a smile [in an assembly of Bodhisattvas], then various-coloured
rays issue from the Lord’s mouth, - rays blue, yellow, red, white, crimson, crystal, silverfish
and golden.These rays illuminate endless and boundless world systems with their lustre,
they rise right up to the world of Brahma, again return from there to the Lord, circulate
thrice round the Lord, and then vanish again in the head of the Lord.

(458) Thereupon the venerable Ananda rose from his seat, put his upper robe over one shoulder,
placed his right knee on the earth, bent his folded hands towards the Lord, and said: It
is not without reason that the Tathagatas manifest a smile.What is the reason for your smile,
O Lord? The Lord: Those six thousand monks, Ananda, shall in a future period, in the
Starlike aeon, know full enlightenment, and after that demonstrate dharma to beings.They
all shall bear the same name. With Avakirnakusuma for their namethese Tathagatas shall be
teachers in the world.They shall all have an equal congregation of disciples.They shall all
live the same length of time, i.e. twenty thousand aeons.Each one of them shall have an
extensive holy writ, that shall spread widely among Gods and men.In each case their good law
shall abide for the same length of time, for twenty thousand aeons.And showers of flowers,
of all the five colours, shall descend on all of them - wherever they may leave the home
which they had in village, town or marketplace, wherever they may turn the wheel of dharma,
wherever they may dwell, wherever they may appear [among people]. (459,1)
