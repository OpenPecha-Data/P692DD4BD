4. Deep marks, and how they are fastenedThereupon, headed by Sakra, Chief of Gods, the Gods
of the realm of sense-desire and of the realm of form and twenty thousand of the Gods of the
realm of Brahma came to where the Lord was, saluted his feet with their heads, stood on
one side,and said: Deep dharmas are being revealed, O Lord.How, O Lord, are the marks fixed
onto them? (273) The Lord: The marks are fixed on to the fact that they are empty,signless,
wishless,not brought together, not produced, not stopped, not defiled, not purified,
that they are non-existence, Nirvana, the realm of Dharma, and Suchness.For those marks are
not supported by anything.They are like unto space.Those marks are not fixed on by the Tathagata,they
cannot be reckoned among the skandhas,they are not dependent on the skandhas,they
are not fixed on by Gods, Nagas or men,and they cannot be shaken off by the world with
its Gods, men and Asuras.For also this world with its Gods, men and Asuras has just that
mark.No hand has fixed on those marks.Would it be correct to say that this space is fixed
on by something? The Gods: No, Lord,because it is unconditioned.The Lord: So it is, O Gods.Independent
of whether Tathagatas are produced or not, (274) those marks stand out just
as such.In accordance with what stands out just as such has the Tathagata described their
reality, after he had fully known it.Therefore is the Tathagata called a ‘Tathagata.’

Subhuti: Deep, O Lord, are these marks which the Tathagata has fully known.But this perfection
of wisdom is the unattached cognition of the Tathagatas.As a field of unattached cognition
is the perfection of wisdom the range of the Tathagatas.
