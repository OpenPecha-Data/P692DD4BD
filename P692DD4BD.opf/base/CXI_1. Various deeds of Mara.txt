1. Various deeds of MaraSubhuti: The Lord has proclaimed these virtues of those sons and daughters
of good family.Are there again any obstacles which will arise to them? The Lord: Many
will be the deeds of Mara that will cause obstructions to them.Subhuti: Of what kind are
they? The Lord: The Bodhisattvas who teach the perfection of wisdom will understand it only
after a long time.Or, after understanding has been generated, it will immediately again
be disturbed.Or they will write yawning, laughing and sneering.Or they will study it with
their thoughts disturbed.Or they will write with their minds on other things.Or they will
not gain mindfulness.Or they will write while deriding one another,or while sneering at
one another,or with distracted eyes.(233) Or their writing will be in mutual discord.“We gain
no firm footing in it, we derive no enjoyment from it,” with these words they will get
up from their seats and take their leave.Their thoughts devoid of serene faith they will
think ‘we are not predestined for this perfection of wisdom,’ will get up from their seats
and leave.Or, because this book does not name the place where they were born, does not mention
their own name and clan, nor that of their mother and father, nor that of their family,
they may decide not to listen to the perfection of wisdom, and take their leave.And each
time they take their leave, they will again and again have to take to birth-and-death for
as many aeons as they have had productions of thought, and during those aeons they will
have to make new efforts.For what reason? Because Bodhisattvas who refuse to listen to this
perfection of wisdom cannot go forth to the spiritual dharmas, be they worldly or supramundane.
