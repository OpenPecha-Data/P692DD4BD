1. Relative value of tathagata-relics and of perfect wisdom

The Lord: If, Kausika, on the one hand you were given this Jambudvipa filled up to the top with
relics of the Tathagatas; and if, on the other hand, you could share in a written copy
of this perfection of wisdom; and if now you had to choose between the two, which one would
you take? Sakra: Just this perfection of wisdom.Because of my esteem for the Guide of the
Tathagatas.Because in a true sense this is the body of the Tathagatas.As the Lord has said:
“The Dharma-bodies are the Buddhas, the Lords.But, monks, you should not think that this
individual body is my body.Monks, you should see Me from the accomplishment of the Dharma-body.”But
that Tathagata-body should be seen as brought about by the reality-limit, i.e.
by the perfection of wisdom.It is not, O Lord, that I lack in respect for the relics of
the Tathagata.On the contrary, I have a real respect for them.As come forth from this perfection
of wisdom are the relics of the Tathagata worshipped,and therefore, when one worships
just this perfection of wisdom, then also the worship of the relics of the Tathagata is
brought to fulfilment.For the relics of the Tathagata have come forth from the perfection
of wisdom.It is as with my own godly seat in Sudharmā, the hall of the Gods. When I am seated
on it, (95) the Gods come to wait on me.But when I am not, the Gods, out of respect
for me, pay their respect to my seat, circumambulate it, and go away again.For they recall
that, seated on this seat, Sakra, the Chief of Gods, demonstrates Dharma to the Gods of the
Thirty-three.In the same way, the perfection of wisdom is the real eminent cause and conditionwhich
feeds the all-knowledge of the Tathagata.The relics of the Tathagata, on the
other hand, are true deposits of all-knowledge,but they are not true conditions, or reasons,
for the production of that cognition.As the cause of the cognition of the all-knowing the
perfection of wisdom is also worshipped through relics of the Tathagata.For this reason,
of the two lots mentioned before, I would choose just his perfection of wisdom.But it is
not because I lack in respect for the relics of the Tathagata.[In choosing thus] I have real
respect for them,for those relics are worshipped because pervaded by the perfection of
wisdom.And, if I had to choose between a copy of the perfection of wisdom on the one side,
and even a great trichiliocosm filled to the top with relics of the Tathagata on the other,(96)
I would still choose just this perfection of wisdom, for the same reasons.For the
relics of the Tathagata are true deposits of the cognition of the all-knowing,but that cognition
itself has come forth from the perfection of wisdom.Therefore then, of those two lots
I would choose just this perfection of wisdom.But it is not that I lack in respect for
the relics of the Tathagata.[In choosing thus] I have real respect for them.They, however,
are worshipped because they have come forth from this perfection of wisdom, and are pervaded
by it.
