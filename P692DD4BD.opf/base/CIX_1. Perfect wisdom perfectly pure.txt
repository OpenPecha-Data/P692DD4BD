1. Perfect wisdom perfectly pureSubhuti: To call it ‘perfection of wisdom,’ O Lord, that is
merely giving it a name.And what that name corresponds to, that cannot be got at.One speaks
of a ‘name’ with reference to a merely nominal entity.Even this perfection of wisdom cannot
be found or got at.In so far as it is a word, in so far is it perfect wisdom;in so far
as it is perfect wisdom, in so far is it a word.No duality of dharmas between those two can
either be found or got at.For what reason then will Maitreya, the Bodhisattva, the great
being, after he has won the supreme enlightenment, preach just this very same perfection
of wisdom at this very spot of earth in just these same words? The Lord: The reason is that
Maitreya will be fully enlightened as to the fact that the skandhas are neither permanent
nor impermanent, that they are neither bound nor freed, that they are absolutely pure.

Subhuti: Perfectly pure indeed is the perfection of wisdom.(201) The Lord: Perfect wisdom is
perfectly pure because the skandhas are pure,and because their non-production is perfectly
pure, their non-stopping, their non-defilement and their non-purification.It is pure because
space is pureand because the skandhas are stainless, and the defiling forces cannot take
hold of them.Perfect wisdom is perfectly pure because, like space or an echo, it is unutterable,
incommunicable, and offers no basis for apprehension.It is perfectly pure because
it is not covered by any dharma, stained or stainless.
