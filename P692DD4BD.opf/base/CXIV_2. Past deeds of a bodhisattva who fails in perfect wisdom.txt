2. Past deeds of a bodhisattva who fails in perfect wisdomOn the other hand, if a Bodhisattva
in the past has heard this deep perfection of wisdom but has asked no questions about it,
and if later on, when he is reborn among men and hears this deep perfection of wisdom being
taught, he hesitates and is stupefied and cowed, then one can be sure that in the past
also he was one of those who were unwilling to ask questions.

Another Bodhisattva, again, may in the past have had the right attitude to this deep perfection
of wisdom, for one, two, three, four or five days, and now only for a certain time he
has faith in it, but afterwards it is withdrawn again and he no longer feels like asking questions
about it.For it is a fact that if (286) a Bodhisattva has in the past not all the
time asked questions about this deep perfection of wisdom, and has not pursued it all the
time, then later on he would at some time feel urged to pursue the hearing of this deep perfection
of wisdom, but not so at other times;he would again fall from his faith, become
disheartened,and his intelligence would become unsteady,and like cotton wool.One can be sure
that such a Bodhisattva has but lately set out in the vehicle.Come but lately to the vehicle,
he will lose his faith in it, his serene confidence in it, his urge for it, in other
words he will no further take up this perfection of wisdom, and pursue it.One must expect
that he will move on either of two levels, on the level of a Disciple, or on the level of
a Pratyekabuddha.
