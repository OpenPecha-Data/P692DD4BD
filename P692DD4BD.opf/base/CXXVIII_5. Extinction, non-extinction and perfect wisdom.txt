5. Extinction, non-extinction and perfect wisdomFor perfect wisdom has no limits,it is inexhaustibleand
boundless.(467) Because limits, exhaustion and bounds are absent in perfect wisdom.To
attribute limits, exhaustion and bounds to perfect wisdom would be like attributing
them to space.For the perfection of wisdom is unlimited,inexhaustibleand boundless.I have
not taught that the perfection of wisdom has any limits, that it can be exhausted, that
it has any bounds.The sum total of the words contained in this Sutra on perfect wisdom certainly
has its limits, but not so the perfection of wisdom itself. For the sum total of the
words in this Sutra is not identical with the perfection of wisdom itself.Perfect wisdom
itself is not subject to any limitations, it is without any limits whatever.

Ananda: For what reason again has the Lord not taught any limits to perfect wisdom? The Lord:
Because it is inexhaustible and isolated.One cannot even apprehend the isolatedness of an
isolated dharma, how much less can there be a definite circumference to it? Thus, as beyond
all measurements the perfection of wisdom is unlimited, without any limits whatever.The
Tathagatas of the past have drawn their strength from just this perfection of wisdom, (468,1)and
yet it has not been exhausted, nor become extinct.The Tathagatas of the future also
shall draw their strength from just this perfection of wisdom,and yet it shall not be exhausted,
shall not become extinct.Those Tathagatas also who just now reside in countless
world systems, they also draw their strength from just this perfection of wisdom,and yet it
does not become exhausted or extinct.I also, who am a Tathagata just now,I also draw My
strength from just this perfection of wisdom,and yet it does not become exhausted, or extinct.One
can exhaust the perfection of wisdom no more than one can exhaust space.This perfection
of wisdom is therefore quite inexhaustible.

Thereupon it occurred to the venerable Subhuti: Deep is this station which the Tathagata has
taught.Let me then now question the Tathagata about this station.And Subhuti said to the
Lord: Inexhaustible, O Lord, is perfect wisdom! The Lord: Because it cannot become extinct,
since, like space, it cannot be extinguished, and since all dharmas have not been produced.Subhuti:
How should a Bodhisattva consummate the perfection of wisdom? The Lord: Through
the non-extinction of form, etc.(469) Through the non-extinction of ignorance,of the karma-formations,
of consciousness, of name and form, of the six sense-fields, of contact, of
feeling, of craving, of grasping, of becoming, of birth, of decay and death, of grief, lamentation,
pain, sadness and despair.In this manner the Bodhisattva surveys conditioned coproduction
in such a way that he avoids the duality of the extremes.He surveys it without
seeing any beginning, end or middle.To survey conditioned coproduction in such a manner, that
is the special dharma of the Bodhisattva who is seated on the terrace of enlightenment.When
he thus surveys conditioned coproduction, he acquires the cognition of the all-knowing.For
a Bodhisattva who, while he courses in perfect wisdom through this consummation of
non-extinction, surveys conditioned coproduction, cannot stand on the level of Disciple or
Pratyekabuddha, but he must stand in all-knowledge.Some Bodhisattvas may turn away from supreme
enlightenment, if, because they have failed to resort to these mental activities [which
aspire to the consummation of non-extinction] and to this skill in means, they do not
know how a Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom should consummate perfect wisdom through
the consummation of non-extinction, (470) and how conditioned coproduction should be
surveyed in the perfection of wisdom through the consummation of non-extinction.All Bodhisattvas
who at any time turn away from full enlightenment do so because they did not resort
to this skill in means.All those Bodhisattvas who at any time do not turn away from full
enlightenment, do so thanks to this perfection of wisdom.In this way should a Bodhisattva
who courses in perfect wisdom consummate perfect wisdom through the consummation of non-extinction.And
in this way should conditioned coproduction be surveyed in the perfection of
wisdom through the consummation of non-extinction.A Bodhisattva who thus surveys conditioned
coproduction, does certainly not review any dharma that is being produced without a cause
nor does he review any dharmas as permanent, stable, eternal, not liable to reversal,nor
does he review any dharmas as a doer or a feeler.This is the surveying of conditioned coproduction
on the part of a Bodhisattva who consummates this perfection of wisdom through
the consummation of non-extinction, and who courses in this perfection of wisdom.At the time
when a Bodhisattva, consummating the perfection of wisdom through the consummation of non-extinction,
surveys conditioned coproduction, at that time he does not review form as if
it were a real separate entity, nor feelings, perceptions, impulses or consciousness; nor
ignorance,karma-formations, etc., to decay and death, (471) sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness
and despair;nor does he review the fact that “this is my Buddha-field” as if it were
real, nor the fact that “that is another Buddha-field,”nor does he review as real any dharma
by which he could distinguish between this and other Buddha-fields.This, Subhuti, is
the perfection of wisdom of the Bodhisattvas, the great beings.
