5. Misdirection of aimMoreover, when people write, or teach the perfection of wisdom, or train
in it, someone will come along and disparage life in the hells, in the animal world, among
the Pretas and Asuras, saying “so ill are all these forms of life, so ill are all conditioned
things;do make an end to just this ill, and leave those beings to their fate.”This
also is a work of Mara.

(246) Or again, someone may come along and praise life among the Gods: “So happy are the Gods,
so happy is life in the heavens. One should therefore tend sense-desires in the world of
sense-desires, enter into the well-known trances in the world of form, and enter into the
well-known attainments in the formless world.”Considered by wisdom all this is, however,
nothing but rebirth in suffering.Because the Lord has said: “I do not praise any kind of
rebirth in becoming, because it lasts no longer than a finger-snap.For everything that is
conditioned is impermanent. Anything that may cause fear is ill. All that is in the triple
world is empty. All dharmas are without self.When the wise have understood that all this
is thus devoid of eternity, impermanent, ill, doomed to reversal, then just here they should
attain the fruits of the holy life, from the fruit of a Streamwinner to Arhatship.Let them
beware of meeting any further with those attainments, which are really failures, and which
abound in suffering.”But nevertheless, to some Bodhisattvas this will be a source of
anxiety [because they will feel deterred from the quest for full enlightenment by a desire
for rebirth among the Gods].This also Mara does to them.
