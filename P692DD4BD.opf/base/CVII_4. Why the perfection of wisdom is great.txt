4. Why the perfection of wisdom is greatThe Lord: What do you think, Subhuti, in what manner
is this perfection of wisdom a great perfection? Subhuti: It does not make form, etc., greater
or smaller, and it does not assemble nor disperse form, etc.It also does not strengthen
or weaken the powers of a Tathagata, nor does it assemble or disperse them.It does not
even make that all-knowledge greater or smaller, nor does it assemble or disperse it.For
all-knowledge is unassembled [uncollected] and undispersed [undisturbed].If the Bodhisattva
perceives even this, then he courses not in the perfection of wisdom,[(cm :: Schlosser:
Both, Vaidya and Wogihara have "carati prajñāpāramitāyām", thus no negation.)]how much more
so if he forms the notion: ‘Thus will I, endowed with the cognition of the all-knowing,
demonstrate dharma to beings, thus will I lead those beings to final Nirvana.’For this apprehension
of beings as a basis fact, when he says, “I will lead those beings to final Nirvana,”
cannot be an outcome of perfection of wisdom.This would indeed be a great basis of apprehension
on his part.For the absence of own-being in beings should be known as belonging
to the very essence of the perfection of wisdom.One should know that the perfection of wisdom
is without own-being because [or: in the same way in which] beings are without own-being;that
the perfection of wisdom is isolated, because beings are isolated;that the perfection
of wisdom is unthinkable, because beings are;(176) that the perfection of wisdom has
an indestructible nature because beings have;that the perfection of wisdom does not actually
undergo the process which leads to enlightenment because beings do not;that the perfection
of wisdom taken as it really is, does not undergo the process which leads to enlightenment
because beings, as they really are, do not undergo that process;that the way in which
the Tathagata arrives at the full possession of his powers should be understood after the
way in which beings arrive at the full possession of their power.It is in this manner that
the perfection of wisdom is a great perfection.
