3. Four similesWhen a ship is wrecked in the middle of the ocean, people will die in the water
without getting to the shore, if they do not find support on a log, or plank, or other
solid body.But those who manage to gain such a support will not die in the water; safely and
unhindered they will cross over to the shore beyond, and stand, unhurt and uninjured, on
firm ground.In the same way, a Bodhisattva who is endowed with but a little faith, just
a little serene confidence, just a little affection, just a little desire-to-do, and who does
not gain the support of perfect wisdom, is bound to incur a fall in the middle of a bad
road, and, without having attained to the state of all-knowledge, he will stand in Discipleship
or Pratyekabuddhahood.Different is the case of a Bodhisattva (287) who has faith in
it, accepts it patiently, has a taste for it, has desire-to-do, vigour, vigilance, resolve,
earnest intention, renunciation, a title to be respected, joyous zest, elation, serene
confidence, affection for it, and persistence in trying to win full enlightenment, and who
also gains the support of the perfection of wisdom;having attained the perfection of wisdom,
he will stand in all-knowledge.If one would use a badly baked jar to carry water in,
that jar would not last long, and would actually quickly fall to pieces and melt away.For
in its unbaked condition it would actually soon come to an end on the ground.Just so, although
a Bodhisattva may have all the qualities enumerated above, from faith to a persistent
desire to win enlightenment,as long as he is not taken hold of by perfect wisdom and skill
in means, he is bound to come to a bad fall in the middle of a bad road,in other words,
he will fall on the level of a Disciple or Pratyekabuddha. But if someone would carry water,
from a river, or lake, or pond, or well, or any other water-bearing place, in a well-baked
jar, then that jar will with the water (288) get safely and uninjured to the house,just
because of the well-baked condition of that jar.Just so a Bodhisattva, who has not only
the qualities enumerated above,but who in addition also has been taken hold of by perfect
wisdom and skill in means,will not in the middle of a bad road incur a fall,and, unhurt and
uninjured, he will stand in all-knowledge.A stupid man would launch into the water a seafaring
vessel which was not caulked or repaired, and had been tied to its moorings for a long
time, would overload it with goods, and mount on it, and set out in it. His ship is doomed
to collapse before it has conveyed the goods across the water.When his ship has burst
asunder,that stupid merchant, who is unskilled in means, will have lost a huge fortune, a
great source of wealth.Just so a Bodhisattva who has all the qualities enumerated above,
but who lacks in perfect wisdom and skill in means, (289) without having gained the wealth
of all-knowledge he is bound to collapse midway, to incur a fall; he has lost a great deal
of his own wealth, and he has also lost a great deal of the wealth of others, because he
has lost all-knowledge, which is like a huge fortune and a great source of wealth;not to
mention his collapse in the middle of the bad road, his fall unto the level of Disciple or
Pratyekabuddha.An intelligent merchant, on the other hand, would construct a solid ship,
would launch it with proper care into the water, load it with goods and distribute them evenly,
and with a favourable wind his vessel would gradually sail to the country which is the
goal of his voyage.His ship will not collapse in the water, it will go to where it is meant
to go,and the merchant will win great wealth in the shape of worldly jewels.Likewise,
a Bodhisattva who has faith, and the other qualities enumerated above, and who in addition
has been taken hold of by perfect wisdom and does not lack in skill in means, it is certain
that he will not collapse in the middle of a bad road, that he will not incur a fall,
that he will stand in supreme enlightenment.For it is a fact that (290) if a Bodhisattva has
faith, and the other qualities enumerated above,and if, in addition, these dharmas of his
have been taken hold of by perfect wisdom, and are not lacking in skill in means, then
they will not hasten towards the level of a Disciple or Pratyekabuddha,but on the contrary
these dharmas will face in the direction of all-knowledge, and they will set out for it,
and they will conduce to the winning of full enlightenment.If a person were very aged, advanced
in years, decrepit, say one hundred and twenty years old, and if he would fall ill in
his body, could he rise from his bed without being taken hold of by others?Subhuti: No,
Lord!The Lord: And even if he could rise from his bed, he would certainly not have the strength
to walk about for half a mile.Wasted away by both old age and illness he could not walk
about for any length of time, even if he could rise from his bed.Likewise, even if a Bodhisattva
has all the qualities enumerated above,if he has not been taken hold of by perfect
wisdom, and is lacking in skill in means, then, although he may have set out for full
enlightenment,he is nevertheless bound to collapse in the middle of a bad road, he is bound
to incur a fall, in other words, he will stand on the level of Disciple or Pratyekabuddha.(291)
This is a necessary consequence of the fact that he has not been taken hold of by
perfect wisdom, and that he lacks in skill in means.But it may be that two strong men take
hold of that old and sick man, and carefully lift him up, and promise him that he may go
wherever he wishes, and as far as he wishes, because they will assist him, and he need not
fear to fall on the way which takes him to the place which he has to go to.In the same way,
a Bodhisattva who has faith, etc., and who is assisted by perfect wisdom, and endowed with
skill in means,he is certain not to collapse in the middle of a bad road, he will not
incur a fall, he is able to reach this station, i.e. the station of full enlightenment.
