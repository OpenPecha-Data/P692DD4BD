1. Conditioned coproductionSubhuti: If a Bodhisattva wins full enlightenment, is that due to
the production of the first thought of enlightenment, or due to the last thought of enlightenment?
Those two acts of thought can nowhere be synthesized [and therefore they cannot
cooperate in producing a result].How can an accumulation of a Bodhisattvaâ€™s wholesome roots
take place? The Lord: What do you think, Subhuti, is the wick of a burning oil lamp burned
up by the first incidence of the flame, or by the last incidence of the flame? Subhuti:
Not so, O Lord!It is not burned up by the first incidence of the flame,nor independent of
it,and it is also not burned up by the incidence of the last flame, nor independent of it.The
Lord: Has then this wick been definitely burn up? Subhuti: Yes, Lord.The Lord: In the
same way, it is neither through the first nor through the last thought of enlightenment,
nor independent of them (353) that a Bodhisattva wins full enlightenment.He does not win it
through these productions of thought, nor otherwise than through them.And yet he does win
full enlightenment.
