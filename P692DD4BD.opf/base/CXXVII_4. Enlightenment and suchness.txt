4. Enlightenment and suchnessMoreover, Subhuti, Bodhisattvas will stand in irreversibility if,
when they hear this deep perfection of wisdom being taught, they resolutely believe in
it, are not stupefied, do not hesitate or doubt; if in the resolute belief that “so it is,
as the Tathagata has taught” they go on listening to it in greater detail; and if they make
up their minds that they will want to listen in still greater detail to this perfection
of wisdom in the presence of the Tathagata Akshobhya; and if they will resolutely believe
when they listen to just this perfection of wisdom in the presence of persons belonging to
the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas who in his Buddha-field lead the holy life.(453) Thus I
teach that merely to hear the perfection of wisdom achieves much. How much more will be achieved
by those who resolutely believe in it,who, after that, take up a position in relation
to Thusnessand progress to Thusness,and who, after that, stand firmly in Suchnessand who,
standing firmly in Suchness and in all-knowledge, will demonstrate dharma.

Subhuti: If, O Lord, one cannot get at any different dharma, distinct from Suchness, then what
is that dharma that will stand firmly in Suchness, or that will know full enlightenment,
or that will demonstrate this dharma? The Lord: One cannot get at any different dharma,
distinct from Suchness, that will stand firmly in Suchness.The very Suchness, to begin with,
is not apprehended, how much less he who will stand firmly in Suchness.Suchness does not
know full enlightenment,and no dharma is got at that has known full enlightenment, that
will do so, or that does so.Suchness does not demonstrate dharma,and that dharma cannot be
got at which would be demonstrated. (454,1)
