3. Nothing procured by perfect wisdomSariputra said to the Lord: How should a Bodhisattva consummate
the perfection of wisdom? The Lord: He should view the non-consummation of form,
etc.The non-consummation of the five skandhas, that is called the ‘consummation’ of the perfection
of wisdom.’In this way, because nothing is effected, the consummation of the five
skandhas is called the consummation of the perfection of wisdom.

Sariputra: When the perfection of wisdom has been consummated by such a consummation, what dharma
does it procure? The Lord: When consummated in such a way, the perfection of wisdom
does not procure any dharma,and in consequence of that fact she comes to be styled ‘perfection
of wisdom.’

Sakra: The, O Lord, this perfection of wisdom does not even procure all-knowledge? The Lord:
It does not procure it as if it were a basis, or a mental process, or a volitional act.(174)
Sakra: How then does it procure? The Lord: In so far as it does not procure, to that extent
it procures.Sakra: It is wonderful, O Lord, to see the extent to which this perfection
of wisdom neither produces nor stops any dharma.For the purpose of the non-production and
of the non-stopping of all dharmas has the perfection of wisdom been set up, without, however,
being really present.

Subhuti: If a Bodhisattva should perceive this also, then he will keep far way from this perfection
of wisdom, treat it as worthless and insignificant, and fail to act on it.The Lord:
This is quite true.For where the perfection of wisdom is lit up, there form does not become
lit up,nor the other skandhas,nor the fruits of the holy life,up to Buddhahood.

Subhuti: This perfection of wisdom is a great perfection, O Lord! (175,1)
