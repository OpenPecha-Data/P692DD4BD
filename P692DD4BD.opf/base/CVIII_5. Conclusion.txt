5. ConclusionThereupon, through the Buddha’s might the four Great Kings in the great trichiliocosm,
and all the Sakras, Chiefs of Gods, and all the great Brahma Gods, and Sahapati, the
great Brahma - all came to where the Lord was.They reverently saluted the Lord’s feet with
their heads, walked three times round the Lord, and stood on one side.Through the Buddha’s
might and through his miraculous power their minds were impressed by the sight of a thousand
Buddhas.(199) In these very words, by monks called Subhuti, etc., has this very perfection
of wisdom been expounded, just this very chapter of the perfection of wisdom.With
reference to it just the Sakras, Chiefs of Gods, ask questions and counter-questions. At
this very spot of earth has just this perfection of wisdom been taught.Maitreya also, the
Bodhisattva, the great being will, after he has won the supreme enlightenment, at this very
spot of earth teach this very same perfection of wisdom.
