2. The bodhisattva protected by the gods, and against MaraSubhuti: So it is.If a Bodhisattva
courses thus, then he courses in perfect wisdom.And the Gods round Indra, round Brahman,
round Prajapati, round Ishana, and the crowds of men and women round the Rishis will from
a distance pay homage with folded hands to a Bodhisattva who courses thus.(447) The Lord:
And not only they, but also all the other Gods, up to the Akanishta Gods, shall pay homage
to him.And with their Buddha-eye the Tathagatas who at present reside in countless world
systems behold the Bodhisattva who thus courses in perfect wisdom,and they help him, and bring
him to mind.It is quite certain, Subhuti, that the Bodhisattvas who course in perfect
wisdom, and who are helped and brought to mind by the Tathagatas, should be borne in mind
as irreversible from full enlightenment.No obstacle put up by Mara or anyone else can stop
them.Even if all beings in the great trichiliocosm should become evil Maras,and if each
one of them would conjure up just as many diabolic armies, (448,1)then even they all together
would not have the strength to obstruct on his way to full enlightenment that Bodhisattva
who is brought to mind by the Buddhas, and who courses in perfect wisdom.And that would
remain true even if all the beings in all the countless trichiliocosms should become evil
Maras, and if each one of them should conjure up just as many diabolic armies.The endowment
with two dharmas safeguards a Bodhisattva against all attacks from the Maras, or their
hosts:He does not abandon any being, and he surveys all dharmas from emptiness.Two other
dharmas have the same effect: As he speaks so he acts, and he is brought to mind by the Buddhas,
the Lords.When a Bodhisattva courses thus, the Gods also will decide to go up to him.They
will decide to ask questions and counter-questions, (449) to honour him, and to strengthen
his determination by saying to him: “Soon, son of good family, shall you know full
enlightenment!Therefore go on dwelling in this dwelling of perfect wisdom!For thereby you
shall become a saviour of the helpless, a defender of the defenceless, a refuge to those
without refuge, a place of rest to those without resting place, the final relief of those
who are without it, an island to those without one, a light to the blind, a guide to the guideless,
a resort to those without one, and you shall guide to the path those who have lost
it, and you shall become a support to those who are without support.”
