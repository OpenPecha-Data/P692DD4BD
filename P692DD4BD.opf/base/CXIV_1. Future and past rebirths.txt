1. Future and past rebirthsSubhuti: If a Bodhisattva, on merely hearing it, immediately believes
in this deep perfection of wisdom, does not become cowed, stolid, paralysed or stupefied,
does not doubt or hesitate, but delights in perfect wisdom, - where has he deceased,
where is he reborn? The Lord: If a Bodhisattva reacts in such a way to the perfection of wisdom,
if he delights in seeing and hearing it, bears it in mind and develops it, keeps his
mind fixed on it without diverting it elsewhere, feels an urge to take it up, bear it in
mind, preach, study and spread it, if, once he has heard of perfect wisdom, he follows and
pursues the reciter of dharma and does not let him go, until he knows this perfection of
wisdom by heart or has got it in the form of a book,just as a cow does not abandon her young
calf, - then this Bodhisattva has deceased among men and will be reborn among men.

(285) Subhuti: Could a Bodhisattva, who is endowed with just these qualities have deceased in
other Buddha-fields before he was reborn here? The Lord: It is quite possible that a Bodhisattva
who is endowed with these qualities, has, before he was reborn here, deceased in
other Buddha-fields, where he has honoured and questioned the Buddhas and the Lords.Or he
may also have deceased among the Tushita Gods.It may be that he has honoured Maitreya, the
Bodhisattva, and persistently questioned him concerning this perfection of wisdom.
