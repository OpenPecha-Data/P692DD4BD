2. How to attend to perfect wisdomThe Lord: When a Bodhisattva reflects, ponders and meditates
on these very deep positions which are connected with perfect wisdom, and strives to stand,
train and progress as it is ordained, described and explained in the perfection of wisdom,(343)
then, if he does so for one day only,how great is the deed he does during that
one day!If a man, moved by considerations of greed, had made a date with a handsome, attractive
and good-looking woman,and if now that woman were held back by someone elseand could
not leave her house,what do you think, Subhuti, with what would that manâ€™s preoccupations
be connected? Subhuti: With the woman, of course.He thinks about her coming, about the things
they will do together, and about the joy, fun and delight he will have with her.The Lord:
Will he have many such ideas in the course of a day? Subhuti: Many indeed, O Lord.The
Lord: As many such ideas as he has in the course of a day, for so many aeons a Bodhisattva
spurns birth-and-death, turns his back on it, seeks to end it.
