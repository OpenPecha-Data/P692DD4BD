8. Antagonism between Mara and BuddhaSubhuti: So it is, O Lord.Whatever is very precious, that
provokes much hostility.Because it is so superior, being hard to get, and of great value.One
should therefore expect that as a rule many obstacles will arise to this perfection
of wisdom.When, overawed by these obstacles, someone becomes lazy, one should know that those
who decide not to learn, study and write this perfection of wisdom are people who are
beset by Mara, have but recently set out in the vehicle, their intelligence is small, sluggish,
limited and perverted,(251) and their thought refuses to function in these very sublime
dharmas.

The Lord: So it is, Subhuti.

And while it is true that these deeds of Mara are bound to arise, a great many agencies will
arise in their turn that oppose the faults of Mara.Those who decide to learn, study and write
this perfection of wisdom have been swayed by the Buddhaâ€™s might, by his sustaining power,by
his grace.(252) For whereas Mara, the Evil One, will make great efforts to cause obstacles,the
Tathagata in his turn will send help.
