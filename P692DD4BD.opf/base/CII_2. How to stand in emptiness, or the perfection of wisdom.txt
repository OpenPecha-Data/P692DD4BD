2. How to stand in emptiness, or the perfection of wisdomSubhuti then said to Sakra: Now, Kausika,
listen and attend well. I will teach you how a Bodhisattva should stand in perfect
wisdom.Through standing in emptiness should he stand in perfect wisdom.(35) Armed with the
great armour, the Bodhisattva should so develop that he does not take his stand on any of
these:not on form, feeling, perception, impulses, consciousness;not on eye, ear, nose, tongue,
body, mind; not on forms, sounds, smells, tastes, touchables, mind-objects; not on eye-consciousness,
etc., until we come to; not on mind-consciouness, etc.,until we come to:
not on the elements, i.e., earth, water, fire, wind, ether, consciousness:not on the pillars
of mindfulness,right efforts, roads to psychic power, faculties, powers, limbs of enlightenment,
limbs of the Path;not on the fruits of Streamwinner, Once-Returner, Never-Returner,
or Arhatship; not on Pratyekabuddhahood, nor on Buddhahood.He should not take his stand
on the idea that ‘this is form,’ ‘this is feeling,’ etc., to: ‘this is Buddhahood.’He should
not take his stand on the ideas that ‘form, etc., is permanent, [or] impermanent’;See
the previous recordSee the previous record(36) that ‘form is ease or ill’;that ‘form is
the self, or not the self,’that ‘form is lovely or repulsive,’that ‘form is empty, or apprehended
as something.’See the previous recordHe should not take his stand on the notion that
the fruits of the holy life derive their dignity from the Unconditioned.Or that a Streamwinner
is worthy of gifts,and will be reborn seven times at the most.Or that a Once-Returner
is worthy of gifts,and will, as he has not yet quite won through to the end, make an end
of ill after he has once more come into this world.Or that a Never-Returner is worthy of
gifts, and will, without once more returning to this world, win Nirvana elsewhere.Or that
an Arhat is worthy of gifts,and will just here in this very existence win Nirvana in the
realm of Nirvana that leaves nothing behind.Or that a Pratyekabuddha is worthy of gifts,and
will win Nirvana after rising above the level of a Disciple, but without having attained
the level of a Buddha.That a Buddha is worthy of gifts,and will win Nirvana in the Buddha-Nirvana,
in the realm of Nirvana that leaves nothing behind, after he has risen above the
levels of a common man, of a Disciple, and of a Pratyekabuddha, wrought the weal of countless
beings, led to Nirvana countless hundreds of thousands of niyutas of kotis of beings,
assured countless beings (37) of Discipleship, Pratyekabuddhahood and full Buddhahood, stood
on the stage of a Buddha and done a Buddha’s work, - even thereon a Bodhisattva should
not take his stand.

Thereupon the Venerable Sariputra thought to himself: If even thereon one should not take one’s
stand, how then should one stand, and train oneself? The Venerable Subhuti, through the
Buddha’s might, read his thoughts and said: What do you think, Sariputra, where did the
Tathagata stand? Sariputra: Nowhere did the Tathagata stand,because his mind sought no support.He
stood neither in what is conditioned, nor in what is unconditioned, nor did he emerge
from them.

Subhuti: Even so should a Bodhisattva stand and train himself. He should decide that ‘as the
Tathagata does not stand anywhere, nor not stand, (38) nor stand apart, nor not stand apart,
so will I stand.’ Just so should he train himself ‘as the Tathagata is stationed, so will
I stand, and train myself.’ Just so should he train himself.‘As the Tathagata is stationed,
so will I stand, well placed because without a place to stand on.’ Even so should a
Bodhisattva stand and train himself.When he trains thus, he adjusts himself to perfect wisdom,
and will never cease from taking it to heart.
