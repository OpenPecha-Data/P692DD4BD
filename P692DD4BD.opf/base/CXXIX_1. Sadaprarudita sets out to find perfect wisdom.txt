1. Sadaprarudita sets out to find perfect wisdomFurthermore, Subhuti, one should search for
perfect wisdom as the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita has done, who at present leads the holy life
in the presence of the Tathagata Bhishmagarjitanirghoshasvara.Subhuti: How then did the
Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita search for the perfection of wisdom? The Lord: First of all Sadaprarudita,
the Bodhisattva, searched for perfect wisdom in such a way that he did not care
for his body, had no regard for his life, and gain, honour and fame did not interest him.He
found himself in the seclusion of a remote forest, and a voice up in the air said to him:
Go East, son of good family!There you shall hear the perfection of wisdom!And on your
way you must not pay any attention to the weariness of your body, you must not give in to
any fatigue, you must pay no attention to food or drink, to day or night, to cold or heat.You
must not make any definite plans, either about inward, or about outward things.You must
not look to the left or right, to the South, East, West or North, upwards or downwards,
or in any of the intermediate directions.And you must not allow yourself to be shaken by self
or individuality,or by form or the other skandhas.(482) For one who is shaken by those,
he is turned away from the Buddha-dharmas.When he is turned away from the Buddha-dharmas,
then he wanders in birth-and-death.And when he wanders in birth-and-death, then he does
not course in perfect wisdom,then he cannot reach the perfection of wisdom.

Sadaprarudita said to the voice: That is how I shall act.Because I want to bring light to all
beings, because I want to procure the dharmas of a Buddha.The Voice answered: Well spoken,
son of good family!

Thereupon the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita again listened to the voice,and what he heard was this:
Son of good family, you should search for perfect wisdom after you have produced the firm
conviction that all dharmas are void, signless and wishless.You must shun signs, existence,
and the false view that there are beings.You must shun bad friends.Good friends, however,
you should tend, love and honour. They are those who demonstrate dharma, and who teach
that “all dharmas are void, signless and wishless, not produced, not stopped and non-existent.”When
you progress like this, you shall before long be able to study the perfection
of wisdom either from a book, or from the mouth of a monk who preaches dharma.And you should
treat as the Teacher that person from whom you may come to hear the perfection of wisdom,you
should be grateful and thankful, and you should think (483,1): “This is my good friend.When
I have heard the perfection of wisdom from him, I shall soon become irreversible
from full enlightenment, shall be quite near the Tathagatas,shall be reborn in Buddha-fields
in which Tathagatas are not lacking,and, avoiding the unfortunate rebirths,I shall accomplish
an auspicious rebirth!”When you weigh up these advantages, you are bound to treat that
monk who preaches dharma as the Teacher.You should not follow him with motives of worldly
gain,but from desire for dharma, out of respect for dharma.You must also see through Mara’s
deeds.For there is always Mara, the Evil One, who may suggest that your teacher tends,
enjoys and honours things that can be seen, heard, smelled, tasted or touched,when in actual
fact he does so from skill in means, and has really risen above them.You should therefore
not lose confidence in him,but say to yourself: “I do not know that skill in means as
he wisely knows it.He tends, enjoys and honours those dharmas, in order to discipline beings,
in order to win wholesome roots for them.For no attachment to objective supports exists
in Bodhisattvas.”After that you should contemplate the true reality of dharmas,i.e. that
all dharmas are without defilement and purification.For all dharmas are empty in their
own-being (484,1),they have none of the properties of a living being, they have no life, no
individuality, no personality, they are like an illusion, a dream, an echo, a reflected
image.When you thus contemplate the true reality of all dharmas, and follow the preacher of
dharma, you shall before long go forth into the perfection of wisdom.But you must watch
out for yet another deed of Mara.If the preacher of dharma should dishearten you by what he
says, that should not make you averse to the perfection of wisdom;but with a mind that desires
only dharma, that respects only dharma, you should, unwearied, follow the monk who
preaches dharma.

After receiving this admonition from the voice, the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita journeyed East.Before
long it occurred to him that he had not asked the voice how far he ought to go.He
stood still just where he was,cried, sorrowed and lamented. For seven days he stayed in that
very spot waiting to be told where he could hear the perfection of wisdom,and all that
time he paid no attention to anything else, and took no food, but simply paid homage to perfect
wisdom.A man, Subhuti, who had lost his only child, would be very sad and unhappy, (485)
and he could think of one thing only, his son and the sorrow he feels from him.Even so
the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita could at that time think of nothing else, except “when then
shall I hear this perfection of wisdom?”
