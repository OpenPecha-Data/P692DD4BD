5. Prediction of the goddess of the GangesThereupon a certain woman came to that assembly, and
sat down in it.She rose from her seat, put her upper robe over one shoulder, saluted the
Lord with folded hands, and said: ‘I, O Lord, when placed in those positions, will not be
afraid,and, without fear, I shall demonstrate dharma to all beings.’Thereupon the Lord at
that time smiled a golden smile.Its lustre irradiated endless and boundless world systems,
it rose up to the Brahma-world, returned from there, circulated three times round the Lord,
and disappeared again in the head of the Lord.When she saw that smile, that woman seized
golden flowers, and scattered them over the Lord.Without being fixed anywhere, they remained
suspended in the air.

(366) Ananda: What is the reason, O Lord, of this smile? It is not without reason that the Tathagatas
manifest a smile.The Lord: This Goddess of the Ganges, Ananda, will, in a future
period, become a Tathagata, “Golden Flower” by name, - an Arhat, fully Enlightened, proficient
in knowledge and conduct, Well-Gone, a knower of the world, unsurpassed, a tamer of
men to be tamed, a teacher of Gods and men,a Buddha, a Lord. In the starlike aeon he will
appear in the world and know full enlightenment.When she has deceased here she will cease
to be a woman, she will become a man. He will be reborn in Abhirati, the Buddha-field of the
Tathagata Akshobhya,in whose presence he will lead the holy life.After his decease there
he will pass from Buddha-field to Buddha-field, never deprived of the sight of the Tathagata.He
will go on passing from Buddha-field to Buddha-field,from here to there, always choosing
those in which he is not without the Buddhas, the Lords.A universal monarch can pass
from palace to palace, and the soles of his feet never, during his entire life, tread upon
the surface of the earth, (367) and he dies without ever, up to the time of his death,
having trodden with his feet on the ground. Just so the Ganges Goddess will pass from Buddha-field
to Buddhafield,and she will never at any time be deprived of the Buddhas and Lords,
until the time of her full enlightenment.

Ananda thought: Those Bodhisattvas who will be with the Tathagata Akshobhya must actually be
considered as the congregation of the Tathagata.The Lord read Ananda’s thoughts, and said:
So it is, Ananda.Those Bodhisattvas who lead the holy life in the Buddha-field of Akshobhya,
the Tathagata, should be known as having emerged from the mud,as having approached to
the accomplishment of enlightenment.In addition, Ananda, the community of the disciples of
the Tathagata “Golden Flower” will not be bound by any measure.For his disciples will be
so many that there will be no measure to them.They will, on the contrary, have to be styled
“immeasurable, incalculable.”In addition, Ananda, at that time, on that occasion there
will be in that Buddha-field no wilderness infested with wild beasts, or with robbers, and
no waterless wastes, and no districts infested by epidemics, and no foodless wastes.(368)
All these, and all other disagreeable places will in that Buddha-field, in no way whatsoever
either be, or be conceived.It is quite certain that, after the Tathagata “Golden Flower”
has known full enlightenment, all these kinds of places which inspire fear and terror will
then no longer exist, or be even conceivable.

Ananda: Who was the Tathagata in whose presence this Goddess of the Ganges has planted the wholesome
root of the first thought of enlightenment, and turned it over to supreme enlightenment?
The Lord: That was under the Tathagata Dipankara.And she actually scattered golden
flowers over the Tathagata when she requested of him [the prediction to] the supreme enlightenment.It
was when I strewed the five lotus flowers over Dipankara, the Tathagata, and
I acquired the patient acceptance of dharmas which fail to be produced, and then Dipankara
predicted my future enlightenment with the words: “You, young man, will in a future period
become a Tathagata, Shakyamuni by name!”Thereupon, when she had heard my prediction, that
Goddess produced a thought to the effect that (369,1): “Oh, certainly, like that young man
I also would like to be predicted to full enlightenment!”And in that way, Ananda, in the
presence of the Tathagata Dipankara, that Goddess planted the wholesome root of the first
thought of enlightenment, [and turned it over to] full enlightenment.Ananda: Certainly,
as one who has made the necessary preparations, as one who has made the grade has this Goddess
of the Ganges been predicted to full enlightenment.The Lord: So it is, Ananda, as you
say.
