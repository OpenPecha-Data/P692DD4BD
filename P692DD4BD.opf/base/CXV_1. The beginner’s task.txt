1. The beginner’s taskSubhuti: How should a Bodhisattva who is only just beginning stand in
perfect wisdom, how train himself? The Lord: Such a Bodhisattva should tend, love and honour
the good friends.His good friends are those who will instruct and admonish him in perfect
wisdom, and who will expound to him its meaning.They will expound it as follows: “Come
here, son of good family, make endeavours in the six perfections.Whatever you may have achieved
by way of giving a gift, guarding morality, perfecting yourself in patience, exertion
of vigour, entering into concentration, (293) or mastery in wisdom, - all that turn over
into full enlightenment.But do not misconstrue full enlightenment as form, or any other skandhas.For
intangible is all-knowledge.And do not long for the level of Disciple or Pratyekabuddha.It
is thus that a Bodhisattva who is just beginning should gradually, through the
good friends, enter into perfect wisdom.”
