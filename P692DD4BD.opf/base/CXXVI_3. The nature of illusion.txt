3. The nature of illusionSubhuti: But how can a thought which is like illusion know full enlightenment?
The Lord: Subhuti, so you see the thought which is like illusion as a separate
real entity? Subhuti: No, Lord.The Lord: Do you see illusion as a separate real entity? Subhuti:
No, Lord.(439) The Lord: When you see neither illusion, nor the thought which is like
illusion, as a real separate entity, do you then perhaps see that dharma which knows full
enlightenment as something other than illusion, or as something other than the thought
which is like illusion? Subhuti: No, Lord,I do not.In consequence, to what dharma could I
point, and say that “it is” or “it is not”? But a dharma which is absolutely isolated, to
that one cannot attribute that “it is” or that “it is not.’Also an absolutely isolated dharma
does not know full enlightenment.Because a dharma which has no existence cannot know
full enlightenment.Therefore then, O Lord, perfect wisdom is absolutely isolated.But a dharma
which is absolutely isolated, that is not a dharma that should be developed,nor does it
bring about or remove any dharma.How then can a Bodhisattva, by resorting to an absolutely
isolated perfection of wisdom, know full enlightenment? Even full enlightenment is absolutely
isolated.(440) If, O Lord, the perfection of wisdom is absolutely isolated, and if
full enlightenment is absolutely isolated, how can the isolated become known through the isolated?
The Lord: So it is, Subhuti.It is just because the perfection of wisdom is absolutely
isolated that the absolutely isolated full enlightenment is known [by it].But if a Bodhisattva
forms the notion that “the perfection of wisdom is absolutely isolated,” then that
is not the perfection of wisdom.It is thus certain that it is thanks to perfect wisdom
that a Bodhisattva knows full enlightenment, and that he cannot know it without resorting
to it.The isolated cannot be known by the isolated, and nevertheless a Bodhisattva knows full
enlightenment,and he does not know it without resorting to the perfection of wisdom.

Subhuti: As I understand the meaning of the Lord’s teaching, a Bodhisattva in this way courses
in a deep object.The Lord:A doer of what is hard is the Bodhisattva who courses in a deep
object, and who yet does not realize that object [or: gain], i.e. on the level of Disciple
or Pratyekabuddha.

Subhuti: As I understand the meaning of the Lord’s teaching, there is in this way no Bodhisattva
at all who is a doer of what is hard.(441) For that very dharma is not got at which could
realize, nor that which could be realized, nor that by means of which one could realize.If,
when this is being taught, a Bodhisattva does not despond, become cowed or stolid,
does not turn back, and remains unafraid, then he courses in perfect wisdom.When he does not
review it as a certain fact that he courses, then he courses in perfect wisdom.If he does
not review it as a real fact that he is near to full enlightenment, then he courses in
perfect wisdom.If it does not even occur to him that he has kept aloof from the level of Disciples
and Pratyekabuddhas, then he courses in perfect wisdom.It does not occur to space
that “I am near to this, or, I am far from that.”For space does not make such discriminations.Just
so it does not occur to a Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom that “full enlightenment
is near to me, the level of Disciple and Pratyekabuddha is far from me.”For the
perfection of wisdom does not make any discriminations.It is as with a man created by magical
illusion to whom it does not occur that “the conjurer is near to me, but the assembled
crowd of spectators is far from me.”For illusory men make no such discriminations.(442)
It is as with the reflection of an object in a mirror or in water, to whom it does not occur
that “the object which produces the reflection is near to me, but those who come along
in that mirror or bowl of water are far from me.”For that reflection of an object makes
no discriminations.Just as a Tathagata, because he has forsaken all constructions and discriminations,
finds nothing dear or not dear, just so a Bodhisattva who courses in perfect
wisdom.For there is no discrimination on the part of perfect wisdom.Just as the Tathagata
is one who has forsaken all constructions and discriminations, even so perfect wisdom has
forsaken all constructions and discriminations.It does not occur to a fictitious creature
which the Tathagata has magically conjured up that “the level of Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas
is far from me, full enlightenment is near to me.”For that fictitious creature does not
make any discriminations.In the same way a Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom does
not think that “the level of Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas is far from me, full enlightenment
is near to me.”And that simply because of lack of all discrimination on the part of
the perfection of wisdom.(443) A fictitious creature [who has been conjured up by the Tathagata]
to do a certain work [in converting beings], performs that work,but remains without
discrimination.Just because it is so constituted that it lacks all discrimination.Just so
a Bodhisattva performs the work for the sake of which he develops the perfection of wisdom,
but the perfection of wisdom remains without discrimination.Because it is so constituted
that it lacks all discrimination.An expert mason, or mason’s apprentice, might make of
wood an automatic man or woman, a puppet which could be moved by pulling the strings.Whatever
action it were made to perform, that action it would perform.And yet that wooden machine
would have no discriminations.Because it is so constituted that it lacks all discrimination.Just
so a Bodhisattva performs the work for the sake of which he develops the perfection
of wisdom, but the perfection of wisdom remains without discrimination.Because that perfection
of wisdom is so constituted that it lacks all discriminations.
