2. AttachmentsThe Lord: Well said, Subhuti.For also names and signs are sources of attachment.Subhuti:
It is wonderful, O Lord, to see the extent to which this perfection of wisdom has
been well taught, well explained, well rounded off. The Lord even announces these sources
of attachment.Sariputra: Which, Subhuti, are these attachments? Subhuti: It is an attachment
if one perceives that the skandhas are empty,that past dharmas are past dharmas,future
dharmas are future dharmas,and present dharmas are present dharmas.It is an attachment
if one forms the notion that someone who belongs to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas begets
so great a heap of merit through his first production of the thought of enlightenment.Sakra:
In which manner, Subhuti, does the thought of enlightenment become a source of attachment?
Subhuti: One becomes attached when one perceives this thought of enlightenment as ‘this
is the first thought of enlightenment,’ and if one converts it into full enlightenment
while conscious that one does so.For it is quite impossible to turn over the essential original
nature of a thought.One should therefore keep in agreement with true reality when one
makes others see the highest, and rouses them to win supreme enlightenment.(191) In that
way one does not waste one’s self away, and the manner in which one rouses others to win
the highest has the sanction of the Buddhas.And one succeeds in abandoning all those points
of attachment.

The Lord: Well said, Subhuti, you who make the Bodhisattvas aware of these points of attachment.I
will now announce other, more subtle, attachments. Listen to them well, and pay good
attention.I will teach them to you.“Well said, O Lord,” and the Venerable Subhuti listened
in silence.

The Lord: Here Subhuti, a son or daughter of good family, full of faith, attends to the Tathagata
through a sign.But, so many signs, so many attachments.For from signs comes attachment.It
is thus that he is conscious that he rejoices in all the dharmas without outflows of
the Buddhas and Lords, past, future and present, and that, after rejoicing, he turns over
into full enlightenment the wholesome root which is associated with his act of jubilation.As
a matter of fact, however, the true nature of dharmas is not past, nor future, nor present;it
lies quite outside the three periods of time;and for that reason it cannot possibly
be converted, cannot be treated as a sign, or as an objective support,and it cannot be seen,
nor heard, nor felt, nor known. (192,1)
