9. Description of bodhisattvas who will study perfect wisdomSariputra: Those Bodhisattvas who
in the North will study this deep perfection of wisdom, will they be many or few? The Lord:
There will be many, a good many Bodhisattvas in the North.But there will be only a few
among them who will study this deep perfection of wisdom, and who, when it is being taught,
will not become demoralized by it. As set out for long in the vehicle should they be known.(227)
In the past already they have pursued, questionedand worshipped that Tathagatas.They
will become morally perfect, and they will promote the welfare of many people, i.e. starting
from just this my supreme enlightenment.For it is just for them that I have preached
just the sermons associated with the state of all-knowledge.In them, even after they have
passed through this present birth, just these ideas associated with the state of all-knowledge
and with the perfection of wisdom, will persist by force of habit.And just this sermon
will they both preach and delight in, i.e. concerning the supreme enlightenment.And they
will be well established in this perfection of wisdom and concentrate on it.They cannot
be diverted from it even by Mara, how much less by other beings, whether they use willpower
or mantras.Because of their firm and irresistible drive towards full enlightenment.From
hearing this perfection of wisdom those sons and daughters of good family will gain an uncommon
degree of zest, elation and serene faith.For many people they will plant wholesome
roots, i.e. in supreme enlightenment.Because in my presence, face to face with me, they have
uttered the vow: “We, coursing in the practices of a Bodhisattva, shall set going on their
way to full enlightenment many hundreds of living beings, yea, many (228) niyutas of
kotis of living beings. We shall hold up perfect enlightenment to them, instigate, encourage
and excite them to win it, help it to come forth, help them to get established in it, help
them to become irreversible.”And when I had surveyed their thought with my thought, I
rejoiced in those sons and daughters of good family who belong to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas
and who had made this vow.In consequence they will become so much confirmed in their
faith that they will seek rebirth in other Buddha-fields,and also there will come face
to face with the Tathagatas there, who demonstrate dharma, and from whom they will hear in
detail just this deep perfection of wisdom.In those Buddha-fields also they will set countless
living beings going on their way to the supreme enlightenment, and will help them in
their quest for full enlightenment.

(229) Sariputra: It is wonderful to think that in past, future and present dharmas there is
nothing that the Tathagata has not seen, not heard, not felt, and of which he is unaware.There
is no dharma that he has not cognized, there is no conduct of any being that he is unaware
of. He has cognized even the future conduct of those Bodhisattvas who are zealous for
enlightenment, who are full of earnest intentions, who have exerted vigour.But among those
sons and daughters of good family who in the future will study this deep perfection of
wisdom, who have exerted themselves on behalf of these six perfections and of the welfare
of all beings, and who seek, search and strive to obtain this deep perfection of wisdom, some
will not obtain it, while others will obtain it without striving to get it.What, O Lord,
is the reason for that? The Lord: So it is, Sariputra.There is nothing in past, future
or present dharmas that the Tathagata has not seen, heard and felt, or of which he is unaware.It
is further true that at that time in that period, some Bodhisattvas who hunt and (230)
search for this perfection of wisdom will not get it.Others will get it without hunting
and searching for it.They will be Bodhisattvas who in the past have persistently hunted
and searched for this perfection of wisdom.It is through the impetus of this former wholesome
root that they will get this perfection of wisdom, in spite of the fact that do not now
hunt and search for it.And also the Sutras different from this one, which welcome just this
perfection of wisdom, will of their own accord come to them.For it is a rule, Sariputra,
that, if a Bodhisattva persistently hunts and searches for this perfection of wisdom, he
will, after one or two births, get it,and also the other Sutras associated with perfect
wisdom will then come to him on their own.

Sariputra: Will only just these Sutras associated with the six perfections come to him, and
no others? The Lord: There will be also other very deep Sutras which will come to this son
or daughter of good family of their own accord.For it is a rule, Sariputra, that, if Bodhisattvas
set others going on their way to full enlightenment, and help them in their quest
for it, (231) help them to become irreversible, and if they also themselves train in that,
then, after they have passed through this present birth, of their own account these very
deep Sutras will come to them, Sutras associated with the non-apprehension of a basis, associated
with emptiness, associated with the six perfections.
