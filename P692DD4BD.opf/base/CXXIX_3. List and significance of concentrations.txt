3. List and significance of concentrationsAs a result he produced a perception which did not
lean on any dharma.And he came face to face with many doors to concentration.The names of
the concentrations were as follows: “It surveys the own-being of all dharmas,”“The non-apprehension
of the own-being of all dharmas,”"Entrance to the cognition of the own-being of
all dharmas,"“Non-difference of all dharmas,”“Spectator of the unchangeability of all dharmas,”“Illuminator
of all dharmas,”“From all dharmas darkness has vanished,”“It shatters the
cognition of all dharmas,”“It tosses all dharmas about,”“The non-apprehension of all dharmas,”“Bedecked
with flowers,”“Within its body it consummates all dharmas,”“Having abandoned
illusion,”“Calling forth images reflected in a mirror,”“Calling forth the sounds of all
beings,”“Without any dirt,”“Gladdening all beings,”“A follower of the vocal sounds of all
beings, from skill in means,”(491) “Consummation of the whole variety of letters, words
and vocal sounds,”“The state which comes from feeling no rigidity,”“Inexpressible in its essential
nature,”“Attainment of unobstructed emancipation,”“Visit from the king,”“Grammatical
analysis of speech into words and letters,”“It has insight into all dharmas,”“It has left

reborn in,”“Free from dirt,”“Undefiled,”“Lotus-array,”“Annihilation of hesitation,”“Follower
of all substantial excellence,”“Elevated above all dharmas,”“Attainment of the super-knowledges,
the powers and the grounds of self-confidence,”“Piercer of all dharmas,”“Seal of
the desisting from becoming on the part of all dharmas,”“The ocean in which all dharmas lose
their becoming,”“Spectator of all dharmas without distinction,”“It has left behind the
jungle of all views and actions,”“Without darkness,”“Without a sign of all dharmas,”(492)
“Freed from all attachment,”“Without a trace of laziness,”“It sheds light on deep dharmas,”“Fashioned
like Meru,”“Irresistible,”“It shatters the circle of Mara’s army,”“No inclination
for anything in the triple world,”“Emission of rays,”“Sight of the Tathagata,”“Spectator
of all Tathagatas.”Established in these concentrations, he saw the Buddhas and Lords in
the countless worlds in the ten directions, as they revealed this very perfection of wisdom
to Bodhisattvas.And those Tathagatas applauded and comforted him, and they said to him:We
also have in the past, when we were Bodhisattvas, searched for the perfection of wisdom
in just the same way.We also, while we were searching, acquired those concentrations which
you have acquired just now.After we had acquired them we have gone on our route, established
in the perfection of wisdom and the irreversible dharmas of a Buddha.But when we survey
the original essential nature and the own-being of these concentrations, then we do not
see any real dharma that enters into them, or that emerges from them, that would course
towards enlightenment, or that would know full enlightenment.This absence of imaginings about
any dharma whatsoever, that is this perfection of wisdom.Because we have stood firm in
the absence of all self-conceited imaginings we have acquired our bodies of golden colour,the
thirty-two marks of the superman,the eighty accessory marks,and the splendid haloes around
us,and we have reached the unthinkable and supreme cognition of Buddhas, the wisdom
of Buddhas, the supreme concentration of Buddhas, and the perfection of all the dharmas and
qualities of Buddhas. (493) Even the Tathagatas cannot grasp the measure, nor define the
boundary, of that perfection of qualities, - how much less the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas.
You should therefore fill your mind with respect for these dharmas of the Buddhas, so
that you should increasingly desire them, so that you should become more and more zealous
for them.Because the supreme enlightenment is not hard to get for one who desires it, who
is zealous for it.For the good friend also should you arouse intense respect and affection,
and serene should be your confidence in him.For it is when they have been taken hold of
by the good friend that Bodhisattvas shall quickly know full enlightenment.

Sadaprarudita asked the Tathagatas: Who is our good friend? The Tathagatas replied: The Bodhisattva
Dharmodgata has for a long time matured you for the supreme enlightenment, he has
upheld you,he has been your preceptor in perfect wisdom, in skill in means, and in the dharmas
of a Buddha.It was he who has upheld you,and for that friendly deed you must honour him
in gratitude and thankfulness, and you must bear in mind what he has done for you.If, son
of good family, you should for one aeon, or for two aeons, or for up to one hundred thousand
aeons, or more, carry about the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata like a turban on your head,
would furnish him with everything that makes beings happy, and would present him with as many
forms, sounds, smells, tastes and touchables as there are in the great trichiliocosm,
(494,1)– even then you would not have repaid that son of good family for what he has done
for you.For it has happened through his might that you have acquired these concentrations,that
you have heard of the perfection of wisdom and of skill in means, and that you have gained
the perfection of wisdom.
