5. Training in perfect wisdomThen the thought came to Sakra, Chief of Gods: Profoundly wise,
surely, is the Holy Subhuti,in that he explains this merely nominal existence [of all separate
things], does not bring it into conflict [with the norm of truth], but enlarges on it
and simply expounds it.He then said to the Venerable Subhuti: So it is.The Bodhisattva should
so train himself therein [in this insight] as the Holy Subhuti points out.Subhuti: So
he should.When he thus train himself,he does not train himself in the fruit of a Streamwinner,
nor in the other fruits of the holy life, up to Buddhahood.When one trains oneself
on those stages, one trains oneself in Buddhahood,or the state of all-knowledge; and thereby
in the immeasurable and incalculable Buddha-dharmas.Thereby one trains oneself neither
for the increase of form, feeling, etc., nor yet for their decrease;(43) neither to appropriate
form, etc., nor to let them go.Nor does one train oneself to get hold of any other dharma,
even of all-knowledge, nor to produce one, or make one disappear.When he trains thus,
a Bodhisattva trains in all-knowledge, and he shall go forth to all-knowledge.

Sakra: Will a Bodhisattva go forth to all-knowledge, even though he does not train himself to
get hold of any dharma, - even of all-knowledge, - nor to produce one, or make one disappear?

Subhuti: He will.

(44) Sakra then said to Sariputra: Where should a Bodhisattva search for perfect wisdom? Sariputra:
In the exposition of the Venerable Subhuti.Sakra: Through whose might, and on whose
authority, does the Holy Subhuti teach perfect wisdom? Sariputra: Through the Tathagata’s
might, and on his authority.Subhuti: It is indeed the Tathagata’s might, Sakra, by which
I teach perfect wisdom.And when you ask, ‘Where should a Bodhisattva search for perfect wisdom?’,
the answer is: He should not search for it in form, nor in any other skandha; nor
in what which is other than form, or other than any other skandha.Because perfect wisdom
is not one of the skandhas, nor yet other than they. (45,1)
