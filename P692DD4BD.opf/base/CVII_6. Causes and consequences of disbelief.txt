6. Causes and consequences of disbeliefIt is quite possible that some Bodhisattvas, although
they have seen many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of Buddhas, and
have led the holy life in their presence, might nevertheless have no faith in the perfection
of wisdom.The reason is that in the past also they have had no respect for this deep perfection
of wisdom when, in the presence of those Buddhas and Lords, it was taught.Because
they lacked in respect for it, they had no desire to learn more about it, did not honour
it, were unwilling to ask questions, and lacked in faith. Lacking in faith they thereupon
walked out of the assemblies. It is because in the past they have produced, accumulated, piled
up and collected karma conducive to the ruin of dharma that also at present they walk
out when this deep perfection of wisdom is being taught.From lack of respect without faith
and firm belief in the perfection of wisdom, they have no concord either in their bodies
or in their thoughts.Devoid of concord they do not know, see, recognise or make known this
perfection of wisdom.First they do not believe,then they do not hear,then they do not see,then
they do not recognise it,and thus they produce, accumulate, pile up and collect karma
conducive to the ruin of dharma.(179) This in its turn will bring about karma conducive
to weakness in wisdom.That in its turn will make them refuse, reject and revile this perfection
of wisdom when it is being taught, and, having rejected it, they will walk out.But
by rejecting this perfection of wisdom they reject the all-knowledge of the Buddhas and Lords,
past, future and present.Not content with having vitiated their own continuities, they
will, as if all aflame, deter, dissuade, turn away others also, - persons of small intelligence,
wisdom, merit and wholesome roots, endowed with but a little faith, affection, serenity,
and desire-to-do, beginners, essentially unqualified, - trying to take away even that
little faith, affection, serenity and desire-to-do. They will say that one should not
train in it, they will declare that it is not the Buddha’s word.They first vitiate and estrange
their own continuities, and then those of others.Thereby they will calumniate the perfection
of wisdom. To calumniate the perfection of wisdom means to calumniate all-knowledge,and
therewith the past, future and present Buddhas.They will be removed from the presence
of the Buddhas and Lords, deprived of the Dharma, expelled from the Samgha.In each and
every way they will be shut out from the Triple Jewel.Their activities cut down the welfare
and happiness of beings, and they will collect from them karma conducive to the great hells.(180)
Because they have raised these karma-formations, they will be reborn in the great
hells, for many hundreds of years, etc. to: for many hundreds of thousands of niyutas of
kotis of aeons.From one great hell they will pass on to another.After a good long time their
world will be consumed by fire.They will then be hurled into the great hells in another
world system, where again they will pass on from great hell to great hell.When also that
world is consumed by fire,they will again be hurled into the great hells in another world
system, where again they will pass on from great hell to great hell.When also that world
is consumed by fire, this karma of theirs will still be unexhausted, will still have some
residue of efficacy and, deceased there, they will again be hurled into this world system.Here
again they will be reborn in great hells,and experience great sufferings in them,until
the time when this world is once more consumed by fire.(181) They will therefore, as we
see, experience a karma which involves many painful feelings.And why? Because their teachings
are so bad.

Sariputra: Even the aftereffect of the five deadly sins bears no proportion to this misconduct
of mind and speech?The Lord: It does not.All those who oppose this perfection of wisdom
and dissuade others from it are persons to whom I do not grant any vision.How can one become
intimate with them, how can they gain wealth, honour and position? As a matter of fact
they should be regarded as defamers of dharma,as mere rubbish,as blackguards, as mere vipers.(182)
They are persons who bring misfortune, they will ruin those who listen to them.For
those who defame the perfection of wisdom should be regarded as persons who defame Dharma.Sariputra:
The Lord has not told us about the length of time such a person must spend in
the great hells.The Lord: Leave that alone, Sariputra.If this were announced those who hear
it would have to beware lest hot blood spurt out of their mouths, lest they incur death
or deathly pain, lest harsh oppression weigh them down, lest the dart of grief enter their
hearts, lest they drop down with a big fall, lest they shrivel up and wither away,lest
they be overpowered by great fright.

– So the Lord refused to answer the Venerable Sariputra’s question.For a second time, for a
third time the Venerable Sariputra spoke thus to the Lord: Tell me, O Lord, the length of
that person’s sojourn in hell,as a guidance for future generations.The Lord: Because he has
brought about, accumulated, piled up and collected this karma of mind and speech he must
sojourn for a long while in the great hells.Just so much guidance will be given to future
generations, that he will, in consequence of the unwholesome karma-formations of this misconduct
of speech and mind, experience pain for just so long. The mere announcement of the
measurelessness and magnitude of his pain will be a sufficient source of anxiety to virtuous
sons and daughters of good family.(183) It will turn them away from activities conducive
to the ruin of dharma, they will cause the formation of merit, and they will not reject
the good dharma, even to save their lives, for they do not wish to meet with such pains.

Subhuti: Such a person should become well-restrained in the deeds of his body, speech or mind.For
so great a heap of demerit is begotten by such false teachings.Which, O Lord, is the
deed that begets so great a heap of demerit?The Lord: Such false teachings do.Just here there
will be deluded men, persons who have left the world for the well-taught Dharma-Vinaya,
who will decide to defame, to reject, to oppose this deep perfection of wisdom.But to oppose
the perfection of wisdom is to oppose the enlightenment of the Buddhas and Lords.And
that means that one opposes the all-knowledge of the Buddhas and Lords in past, future and
present.To oppose all-knowledge means to oppose the good dharma.To oppose the good dharma
means to oppose the community of the Disciples of the Tathagata.And when one opposes also
the community of the Disciples of the Tathagata, then one is shut out in each and every
way from the Triple Jewel. One has then managed to acquire an unwholesome karma-formation
which is greater than immeasurable and incalculable.

Subhuti: For what reason (184) do those people believe that they should oppose this perfection
of wisdom? The Lord: Such a person is beset by Mara.His karma is conducive to weakness
in wisdom, and so he has no faith or serene confidence in deep dharmas.Endowed with those
two evil dharmas he will oppose this perfection of wisdom.Moreover, Subhuti, that person will
be one who is in the hands of bad friends; or he may be one who has not practised; or
one who has settled down in the skandhas; or one who exalts himself and deprecates others,
looking out for faults.Endowed also with these four attributes will be that person who believes
that this perfection of wisdom should be opposed when it is being taught.
