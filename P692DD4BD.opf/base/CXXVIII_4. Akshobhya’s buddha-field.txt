4. Akshobhya’s buddha-fieldThereupon the Lord on that occasion exercised His wonderworking power.
The entire assembly – monks, nuns, laymen and laywomen, Gods, Nagas, Yakshas, Gandharvas,
Asuras, Garudas, Kinnaras, Mahoragas, men and ghosts – they all, through the Buddha’s
might, (465) saw the Tathagata Akshobhya surrounded by the congregation of monks, accompanied
by a retinue of Bodhisattvas demonstrating dharma, in an assembly which was vast like
the ocean, deep and imperturbable, surrounded and accompanied by Bodhisattvas who were endowed
with unthinkable qualities, all of them Arhats, - their outflows exhausted, undefiled,
fully controlled, quite freed in their hearts, well freed and wise, thoroughbreds, great
Serpents, their work done, their task accomplished, their burden laid down, their own weal
accomplished, with the fetters that bound them to becoming extinguished, their hearts
well freed by right understanding, in perfect control of their entire hearts.

Thereupon the Lord again withdrew His wonderworking power.The Lord Akshobhya, the Tathagata,
then no longer appeared,and all those Bodhisattvas and great Disciples, and that Buddha-field
no longer came within the range of vision of the members of the Lord’s assembly.For the
Tathagata had drawn in His wonderworking power.

And The Lord said to Ananda: In the same way, Ananda, all dharmas do not come within the range
of vision. Dharmas do not come within the range of vision of dharmas, dharmas do not see
dharmas, dharmas to not know dharmas.For all dharmas are of such a nature that they can
be neither known nor seen, and they are incapable of doing anything.For all dharmas are inactive,
they cannot be grasped, because they are as inactive as space.All dharmas are unthinkable,
similar to illusory men.All dharmas are unfindable, because they are in a state of
non-existence.When he courses thus a Bodhisattva courses in perfect wisdomand he does not
settle down in any dharma.(466) When the trains thus, a Bodhisattva trains in perfect wisdom.If
a Bodhisattva wants to attain the great enlightenment, which is the highest perfection
of all training, then he should train in perfect wisdom.For the training in perfect wisdom
has been described as the foremost of all trainings, as the best, the choicest, the
most excellent, the most sublime, the highest, the utmost, the unequalled, the incomparable,
it has been said to bring benefit and happiness to all the world, it has been described
as a protector of the helpless, it has been ordained and extolled by the Buddha.The Tathagatas
could, as a result of training in this perfection of wisdom, of having stood in this
training, lift up this great trichiliocosm with one big toe, and then just let it drop again.But
it would not occur to those Buddhas and Lords that “this great trichiliocosm has been
lifted up, has been dropped again.”For perfect wisdom is endowed with immeasurable and
incalculable qualities.As a result of training in this training of perfect wisdom, the Buddhas
and Lords have reached a state of non-attachment to past, future and present dharmas.Of
all the possible trainings in the past, future and present period, this training in perfect
wisdom is the foremost, the best, the choicest, the most excellent, the most sublime,
the highest, the utmost, the unequalled, the incomparable.
