4. Sakra’s flowersThereupon the thought came to Sakra: Let me now, in order to do worship to
this discourse on dharma which is being taught by the Holy Subhuti, conjure up some flowers,
and scatter them over the Holy Subhuti.Sakra then conjured up flowers, and scattered them
over the Venerable Subhuti.The Venerable Subhuti thought to himself by the way of reply:
These flowers which [now] appear among the Gods of the Thirty-three I had not noticed before.These
flowers, which Sakra has scattered, are magical creations. They have not issued
from trees, shrubs or creepers. These flowers which Sakra has scattered are mind-made.Sakra
replied: These flowers did not issue forth at all.For there are really no flowers, whether
they issue forth from mind, or from trees, shrubs or creepers.Subhuti then said to him:
As you say, Kausika, ‘these flowers did not issue forth at all, (42) neither from mind,
nor from trees shrubs or creepers’– because that which has never issued forth is not a flower.
