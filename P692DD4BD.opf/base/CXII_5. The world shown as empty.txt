5. The world shown as emptyThe Lord: So it is, Subhuti.It is thus that the perfection of wisdom
instructs the Tathagatas in this world.To the extent that the Tathagatas dwell in intimate
dependence on this dharma, the perfection of wisdom, to that extent are those dharmas,
which stand out for ever, fully known by the Tathagatas, through their taking their stand
nowhere.Thereby they dwell in close and intimate dependence on just the Dharma. They treat
the Dharma with respect, revere, worship and adore it,for they know that this essential
nature of dharmas is just the perfection of wisdom.For the all-knowledge of the Tathagatas
has been brought about from this perfection of wisdom,and for that the Tathagatas are grateful
and thankful to her.With justice can the Tathagata be called ‘grateful and thankful’
[kritajña kritavedin].In gratitude and thankfulness the Tathagata (275) favours and cherishes
the vehicle on which he has come, and the path by which he has won full enlightenment.That
one should know as the gratitude and thankfulness of the Tathagata.In addition, the
Tathagata has fully known all dharmas as not made [akrita], as not unmade, as not brought
together.This also one should know as the gratitude and thankfulness of the Tathagata.For
it is thanks to the perfection of wisdom that the cognition of the Tathagata has thus proceeded
in all dharmas.That is another aspect of the fact that perfect wisdom instructs the
Tathagatas in this world.

Subhuti: But how can perfect wisdom instruct the Tathagatas in this world if all dharmas are
unknowable and imperceptible? The Lord: It is good, Subhuti, that you should have decided
to question the Tathagata about this matter.All dharmas are indeed unknowable and imperceptible.Because
they are empty,and do not lean on anything.It is thus that all those dharmas
have, thanks to perfect wisdom, been fully known by the Tathagatas.For another reason also
the perfection of wisdom can be regarded as the instructress of the Tathagatas in this
world, i.e. because none of the skandhas has been viewed.

(276) Subhuti: How can there be a non-viewing of form, etc.? The Lord: Where there arises an
act of consciousness which has none of the skandhas for objective support, there the non-viewing
of form, etc., takes place.But just this non-viewing of the skandhas is the viewing
of the world.That is the way in which the world is viewed by that Tathagata.It is thus that
perfect wisdom acts as an instructress in the world to the Tathagatas.And how does perfect
wisdom show up the world for what it is? She shows that the world is empty,unthinkable,
calmly quiet.As purified of itself she shows up the world, she makes it known, she indicates
it.
