2. Pride in connection with the annunciation of the nameMoreover, Subhuti, the deeds of Mara
will operate also in connection with the annunciation of a Bodhisattva’s name.And how? Mara
uses even the annunciation of the name, and of the other details connected with it, to
tempt a Bodhisattva.He comes to him in all kinds of disguises, and says to him: “You have
had your prediction from the Tathagatas in the past.The proof is that this is the name you
will have as a Buddha,and these are the names of your mother,your father,your brother,your
sister,your friends, maternal relatives, kinsmen and relations.”He proclaims these names
backwards through seven generations. He tells you that you were born in this region, this
country, this village, town or marketplace.(387) If you have any particular quality, he will
tell you that you have had that same quality also in the past.Whether the Bodhisattva
be dull by nature, or keen in his faculties, Mara will tell him that he was the same in the
past.Or take other qualities which he has in this present life: He is, say, a forest dweller,
or one who begs for his food from door to door without accepting invitations, or he
wears clothes made of rags taken from a dust heap, or he never eats any food after midday
or he eats his meal in one sitting, or he sleeps at night wherever he may happen to be, or
he possesses no more than three robes, or he lives in and frequent cemeteries, or he dwells
at the foot of a tree, or even in his sleep he remains in a sitting posture, or he lives
in an open, unsheltered place, or he wears a garment made of felt, or he has few wishes,
is easily contented, detached, frugal, soft in speech, or a man of few words, - in each case
Mara will announce to him that also in the past he has been endowed with this same quality,and
that for certain the Tathagatas of the past must have predicted him to full enlightenment
and to the stage of an irreversible Bodhisattva,for he now has the just mentioned
qualities of an austere ascetic,and he must therefore in all certainty also have been endowed
with them in the past.It may be that then a Bodhisattva feels conceit when he thinks
of the annunciation of his names and circumstances in the past, and of his present austere
penances as a rigid ascetic.He may actually think that he has had his prediction in the past
because now he has those qualities of a rigid ascetic.And Mara will confirm him in this
view.(388) In the guise of a monk, or nun, or lay brother, or lay sister, or Brahmin, or
householder, or mother, father, brother, sister, friend or relative Mara will come to the
Bodhisattvaand tell him that he has had his prediction in the past to full enlightenment
and to the irreversible stage of a Bodhisattvafor the simple reason that now he has those
qualities of a rigid ascetic, which, according to him, are the qualities of an irreversible
Bodhisattva.But the Bodhisattva has not got the attributes, tokens and signs of an irreversible
Bodhisattva which I have described.He is surely a man beset by Mara, unlike those
other Bodhisattvas [who could be his good friends].For he has not got the attributes, tokens
and signs which are actually characteristic of an irreversible Bodhisattva.And as a result
of the annunciation of the circumstances of his past he feels conceit.In his conceit,
overcome by great and rigid conceit, defeated by the magical power of Mara, he despises his
fellow-Bodhisattvas, sneers at them and deprecates them.One should recognize this as a deed
of Mara, who makes use of the annunciation of the past circumstances of a Bodhisattva.

(389) Furthermore, Subhuti, Mara also operates in connection with the prediction of the name
which a Bodhisattva will have as a Buddha.In the guise of a monk he comes to a Bodhisattva
and predicts to him that “this will be your name when you have won full enlightenment.”
And Mara will predict that name which the Bodhisattva had already guessed for himself when
he had pondered over the name he would bear after his full enlightenment.If the Bodhisattva
is weak in wisdom, and without skill in means, he reflects that the name which that monk
has mentioned is the same which he had guessed himself.He compares the name which he had
thought out by himself with the name proclaimed by that monk, who is either beset by Mara,
or was conjured up by Mara or his host, he finds that the two agree, and he concludes that
he has in the past been predicted to full enlightenment by the Tathagatas by name.But he
has not got the attributes, tokens and signs of an irreversible Bodhisattva which I have
described.Since he lacks in them, he feels conceit as a result of that prediction of his
name.In his conceit (390) he despises his fellow-Bodhisattvas, and thinks that, while he has
had his prediction, they have not had it.That pride, arrogance and conceit which makes
him despise those other Bodhisattvas keep him far away from all-knowledge and the cognition
of a Buddha.Not upheld by perfect wisdom, lacking in skill in means and the good friend,
taken hold of by the bad friend, he would, we must expect, belong to one of the two levels,
that of a Disciple, or that of a Pratyekabuddha.But even if, after he has spent a long
time, a good long time in erring about and in wandering about [in birth-and-death], he would
again become one who wants to know full enlightenment by resorting to just this perfection
of wisdom; and if he were to go to the good friends and regularly approach them; and if,
in his newfound outlook on life he would, first of all, censure his former ideas, vomit
them up, abhor them, throw them back, see their error, - even then it will be hard for him
to get to the Buddha-level.So serious is the offence of conceitedness.Among the monks who
belong to the vehicle or level of the Disciples four unforgivable offences are so serious
that, if someone has been guilty of one of them, he ceases to be a monk, a Shramana, a son
of the Shakya. More serious than those four unforgivable offences is this production of
a proud thought, when, on the occasion of the prediction of his name, a Bodhisattva has despised
other Bodhisattvas, and produced a thought which is very unwholesome, which is more
serious than the four unforgivable offences.

Not only that, but it is more serious even than the five deadly sins, this production of a thought
connected with pride, (391) produced on the occasion when a Bodhisattva’s future name
[as a Buddha] is announced.That thought is more serious even than the five deadly sins.In
this way, even through the annunciation of a Bodhisattva’s name very subtle deeds of Mara
may arise.They should be recognized for what they are, and avoided, both by the Bodhisattva
himself, and by others.
