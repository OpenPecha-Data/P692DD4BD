4. Perfect wisdom, and the other perfectionsAnanda: The Lord does not praise the perfection
of giving, nor any of the first five perfections; he does not proclaim their name.Only the
perfection of wisdom does the Lord praise, its name alone he proclaims.The Lord: So it is,
Ananda.For the perfection of wisdom controls the five perfections.What do you think, Ananda,
can giving undedicated to all-knowledge be called perfect giving? Ananda: No, Lord.The
Lord: The same is true of the other perfections.(81) What do you think, Ananda, is that
wisdom inconceivable which turns over the wholesome roots by dedicating them to all-knowledge?
Ananda: Yes, it is inconceivable,completely inconceivable.The Lord: The perfection of
wisdom therefore gets its name from its supreme excellence [paramatvāt]. Through it the wholesome
roots, dedicated to all-knowledge, get the name of ‘perfections.’It is therefore
because it has dedicated the wholesome roots to all-knowledge that the perfection of wisdom
controls, guides and leads the five perfections.The five perfections are in this manner
contained in the perfection of wisdom, and the term ‘perfection of wisdom’ is just a synonym
for the fulfilment of the six perfections.In consequence, when the perfection of wisdom
is proclaimed, all the six perfections are proclaimed.Just as gems, scattered about in the
great earth, grow when all conditions are favourable;and the great earth is their support,and
they grow supported by the great earth;even so, embodied in the perfection of wisdom,
the five perfections rest in all-knowledge,they grow supported by the perfection of wisdom;and
as upheld by the perfection of wisdom do they get the name of ‘perfections.’ (82,1)So
it is just the perfection of Wisdom that controls, guides and leads the five perfections.
