4. IrreversibilitySuppose that a Bodhisattva is asked by another Bodhisattva who wants to win
full enlightenment: “Over which dharmas should one achieve complete conquest? What kind
of aspiration should one form in one’s mind, aspirations which enable a Bodhisattva not to
realise emptiness, or the Signless, or the Wishless, or the Uneffected, or non-production,
or non-positivity, but to go on developing the perfection of wisdom?”If the Bodhisattva
answers that just emptiness should be attended to,just the Signless, just the Wishless, just
the Uneffected, just non-production, just no-birth, just non-positivity,and if he should
not make manifest this production of the thought of the non-abandonment of all beings, or
if he should not include skill in means in his answer, then one must know that this Bodhisattva
has not in irreversibility been predicted to full enlightenment by the Tathagatas
of the past.For he does not indicate this special dharma of an irreversible Bodhisattva [i.e.
the non-abandonment of all beings], does not make much of it, does not make it manifest,
does not wisely know it, does not include it in his answer, and he does not induce others
to enter into that stage [of skill in means] which is the true stage of an irreversible
Bodhisattva.

(380) Subhuti: And how can a Bodhisattva, in regard to this question, be regarded as irreversible?
The Lord: He should be known as an irreversible Bodhisattvaif, whether he has heard
this perfection of wisdom or not, he hits upon the correct answer.Subhuti: There are many
who course towards enlightenment,but a few only could give the correct answer.The Lord: Because
few only are the Bodhisattvas who have been predicted to the irreversible stage on
which this cognition becomes possible.But those who have been predestined for it, they will
give the correct answer.One can be sure that they have planted splendid wholesome roots
in the past,and the whole world, with its Gods, men and Asuras, cannot overwhelm them.
