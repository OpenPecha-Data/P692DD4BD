1. The superior position of bodhisattvasAt that time Sakra, Chief of Gods, was seated amid that
assembly,and said: To be sure, deep is this perfection of wisdom,hard to see, hard to
understand!The Lord: So it is, Kausika.With the depth of space is this perfect wisdom deep.As
isolated it is hard to see,as empty it is hard to understand.Sakra: Those beings who hear
this perfection of wisdom, take it up, study, spread, and write it, must be endowed with
more than a puny wholesome root!The Lord: So it is.If all the beings in Jambudvipa were
endowed (411) with [the ability to observe] the ten ways of wholesome action, would they
on the strength of that beget much merit? Sakra: They would, O Lord.The Lord: A person who
hears, studies, spreads and writes this perfection of wisdom begets greater merit than they.The
just mentioned heap of merit, due to the morality of all beings in Jambudvipa, is infinitesimal
compared with the heap of merit which is due to the wholesome root of someone
who hears, studies, spreads and writes this deep perfection of wisdom.

Thereupon a monk said to Sakra, Chief of Gods: You have been surpassed, Kausika, by that person
who hears, studies, spreads and writes this deep perfection of wisdom!Sakra: I am even
surpassed by that son or daughter of good family who has raised but one single thought to
enlightenment:(412) how much more so if in addition they train in Thusness, progress to it,
make endeavours about it;on their journey they surpass the whole world with its Gods, men
and Asuras.On their journey they not only surpass the world with its Gods, men and Asuras,
but also all the Streamwinners, Once-Returners, Never-Returners, Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas.They
surpass also those Bodhisattvas who are great almsgivers but lack in perfect wisdom
and skill in means;and equally those whose morality is perfectly pure, who possess a
vast quantity of morality, whose observation of the moral rules is unbroken, flawless, unstained,
complete, perfectly pure and unspotted, but who lack in perfect wisdom and skill in
means;and equally those who have won patience and peaceful calm, (413) whose thoughts are
free from hostility, who feel no thought of malice even when burned at the stake, but who
lack in perfect wisdom and skill in meansand equally those who have exerted vigour, who
persist in trying, who are free from sloth, and remain uncowed in all they do with body, voice
and mind, but who lack in perfect wisdom and skill in means;and equally those who are
fond of the trances and delight in them, who are strong and powerful in the trances, who
are established in the trances, who are masters of the trances, but who lack in perfect wisdom
and skill in means.For, when he courses in the perfection of wisdom as it has been expounded,
a Bodhisattva surpasses the world with its Gods, men and Asuras, surpasses all those
who belong to the vehicle of the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas, surpasses also the Bodhisattvas
who are not skilled in means. And they cannot surpass him.For a Bodhisattva who
courses in the perfection of wisdom as it has been expounded, who complies with it, has taken
up his position so that the lineage of the all-knowing should not be interrupted,and he
does not keep aloof from the Tathagatas.His journey will, when he progresses in this way,
shortly bring him to the terrace of enlightenment;(414) he will, training himself in this
way, rescue the beings who have sunk into the mud of the defilements.Training himself in
this way, he trains in the training of a Bodhisattva, and not in the training of a Disciple
or Pratyekabuddha.
