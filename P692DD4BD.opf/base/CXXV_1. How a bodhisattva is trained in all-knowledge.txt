1. How a bodhisattva is trained in all-knowledgeSubhuti: Wherein, O Lord, must a Bodhisattva
train to be trained in all-knowledge? The Lord: He must train in Extinction,in Non-production,
in Non-stopping, in No-birth, in the absence of positivity, in Isolatedness, in Dispassion,
in Space, in the element of dharma,and Nirvana.Subhuti: For what reason does that
amount to a training in all-knowledge? The Lord: What do you think, Subhuti,the Suchness of
the Tathagata, which is the prime cause of the Tathagata being a Tathagata, does that become
extinct? Subhuti: No, Lord.For extinction cannot become extinct,extinction being inextinguishable.(425)
The Lord: The Suchness of the Tathagata, which is the prime cause of the
Tathagata being a Tathagata, is that now produced, or stopped, or born; or does it become
or cease to become; or does it become isolated; or impassioned or dispassionate; or does
it become like space, or does it become of the nature of dharma? Subhuti: No, Lord.The Lord:
Does that Suchness then enter Nirvana? Subhuti: No, Lord.The Lord: Therefore then, Subhuti,
a Bodhisattva who trains himself thus, he trains in [the conviction that] “Suchness
does not get extinct.”When he trains thus, he will reach the perfection of all training.He
cannot be crushed by Mara, or by Mara’s associates or by Mara’s host.Soon he shall reach
the condition of irreversibility.Soon he shall sit on the terrace of enlightenment.He courses
in his own range.(426) He is trained in the dharmas which make him into a saviour, in
the great friendliness, the great compassion, the great sympathetic joy, the great impartiality.He
trains for the turning of the wheel of dharma, with its three revolutions and twelve
aspects.He trains so as to save no fewer beings than he should.He trains to ensure the
non-interruption of the lineage of the Tathagatas.He trains in order to open the door of
the deathless element.An inferior being is, however, incapable of this sublime training.For
a weakling cannot be trained in this training.Because those who are trained in this training
are the very cream of all beings, are persons who want to save all beings.They want to
reach a state where they are elevated above all beings.A Bodhisattva who trains thus is
not reborn in the hells, nor among animals, nor in the realms of the Pretas, nor among the
Asuras, nor in outlying districts [among barbarous populations], nor in the families of outcasts
or fowlers, of hunters, fishermen or butchers, nor in other low class families of
that kind, in which one is addicted to low deeds.He does not become blind, deaf, or one-eyed;
he is not a cripple, nor hunch-backed, nor a man with withered hand or arm, nor limping,
or lame, or stunned, (427) not tremulous, quivering or shaky; his limbs are not puny, nor
incomplete, nor abnormal: he is not weak, nor has he a bad complexion or shape; his faculties
are not inferior nor incomplete,but they are in every way perfect; and he has a melodious
voice.He does not become a person who takes life, or who takes what is not given, or
who goes wrong about his sense-desires, or who speaks falsely, or maliciously, or harshly,
or who prattles indistinctly, or who is covetous, or who harbours ill will in his heart,
or who has wrong views, and he does not earn his livelihood in the wrong fashion.He is not
reborn among the long-lived Gods, he does not take up bad moral practices, does not take
hold of unreal dharmas, and he does not get reborn through the influence of his trances
and [formless] attainments.For there is his skill in means, and endowed with that he does
not get reborn among the long-lived Gods.But what is that skill in means of a Bodhisattva?
It is just this perfection of wisdom.And he applies himself to this skill in means in such
a way that, endowed with it, the Bodhisattva enters into the trances without being reborn
through the influence of the trances.(428) When he trains thus, a Bodhisattva incurs the
perfect purity of the powers, of the grounds of self-confidence, of the Buddha-dharmas. He
reaches all that.

Subhuti: But if, O Lord, as we all know, all dharmas are by nature perfectly pure, then with
regard to what dharma does a Bodhisattva incur and reach the perfect purity of the powers,
the grounds of self-confidence and the Buddha-dharmas? The Lord: So it is, Subhuti.For all
dharmas are just by [their essential original] nature perfectly pure.When a Bodhisattva
who trains in perfect wisdom does not lose heart and remains uncowed although all dharmas
are by their nature perfectly pure, then that is his perfection of wisdom.But the foolish
common people do not know nor see that these dharmas are really so constituted, and they
neither know nor see the true nature of dharmas.On behalf of those beings the Bodhisattvas
struggle on and exert vigour so that those who do not know may be enabled to know, so that
those who do not see may be made to see.In this training they train, and therefore [in the
world of appearance] a Bodhisattva reaches the powers, the grounds of self-confidence,and
all Buddha-dharmas.When they train thus, Bodhisattvas wisely know the throbbing thoughts
and actions of other beings, of other persons as they really are.And then they go beyond
the knowledge of the thoughts and actions of others. (429,1)
