6. Irreversibility and the magical power of veracityAnd once more, Subhuti, I will demonstrate
the attributes, tokens and signs by which an irreversible Bodhisattva should be borne in
mind.Listen well and attentively. I will teach you.Subhuti: So be it, O Lord.The Lord: If
a person, - man or woman, boy or girl, - were seized or possessed by a ghost,then a Bodhisattva,
who has come across him, should perform the Act of Truth,and say: “If it is true
that I have been predicted to full enlightenment by the Tathagatas of the past, (384) and
if it is true that my intention to win full enlightenment is perfectly pure,- to the extent
that I want to win full enlightenment and that my attention to it is perfectly pure,to that
extent I have left behind the thoughts of Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas. It is my duty
to win full enlightenment.Not shall I not win full enlightenment!But I shall win just full
enlightenment!There is nothing that the Buddhas and Lords who reside in countless world
systems have not cognized, seen, felt and fully known.Those Buddhas and Lords know my earnest
intention that also I want to win full enlightenment.– Because this is the truth, because
this is an utterance of the Truth, may he depart who seized and possessed that person
with his ghostly seizure!”If, as a result of these words of the Bodhisattva that ghost does
not depart, one should know that the Bodhisattva has not had his prediction;but if he departs
one should know that he has had his prediction to full enlightenment.
