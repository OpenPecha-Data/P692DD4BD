2. Qualifications of a bodhisattva who obtains perfect wisdomSariputra: In front of an irreversible
Bodhisattva, of a Bodhisattva predestined to enlightenment, should the deep perfection
of wisdom be taught.For he will not hesitate, not doubt, not be stupefied, not dispute
it.

(213) Sakra: What would be the fault in teaching this perfection of wisdom in front of an unpredestined
Bodhisattva?Sariputra: If Kausika, unpredestined, a Bodhisattva obtains this perfection
of wisdom, for vision, praise, worship and hearing, and if he remains unafraid when
he hears it, one can be sure that he has come from afar, has set out for long in the vehicle,
and that his wholesome roots are well matured.It will not be long from now onwards
until he receives the prediction to supreme enlightenment.One can be sure that that prediction
will be near,and will come to him before he has passed by one, two or three Tathagatas.And,
of course, he will please the Tathagatas whom he passes by, will please them permanently,and
he will see to it that the vision of those Tathagatas will bear the fruit of the
prediction, that it will lead him to the prediction to supreme enlightenment [itself].

Come from afar, O Lord,set out for long in the great vehicle,with wholesome roots well matured
is that Bodhisattva who obtains this perfection of wisdom for vision, praise, worship and
hearing.How much more so if he would not only hear it, but also take it up, (214) bear
it in mind, preach, study, spread, explain and repeat it.

The Lord: So it is, Sariputra, as you have said.
