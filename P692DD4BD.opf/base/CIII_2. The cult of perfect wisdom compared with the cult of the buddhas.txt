2. The cult of perfect wisdom compared with the cult of the buddhasSakra: Suppose that there
are two persons. One of the two, a son or daughter of good family, has written down this
perfection of wisdom, made a copy of it; he would then put it up, and would honour, revere,
worship, and adore it with heavenly flowers, incense, perfumes, wreaths, unguents, aromatic
powders, strips of cloth, parasols, banners, bells, flags, with rows of lamps all round,
and with manifold kinds of worship. The other would deposit in Stupas the relics of the
Tathagata who has gone to Parinirvana; he would take hold of them and preserve them; he would
honor, worship and adore them with heavenly flowers, incense, etc., as before. Which
one of the two, O Lord, would beget the greater merit? The Lord: I will question you on this
point,and you may answer to the best of your abilities.The Tathagata, when he had acquired
and known full enlightenment or all-knowledge, in which practices did he train the all-knowledge-personality
which he had brought forth? (58) Sakra: It is because the Lord has
trained himself in just this perfection of wisdom that the Tathagata has acquired and known
full enlightenment or all-knowledge.The Lord: Therefore the Tathagata does not derive his
name from the fact that he has acquired this physical personality,but from the fact that
he has acquired all-knowledge.And this all-knowledge of the Tathagata has come forth from
the perfection of wisdom.The physical personality of the Tathagata, on the other hand, is
the result of the skill in means of the perfection of wisdom.And that becomes a sure foundation
for the [acquisition of the] cognition of the all-knowing [by others]. Supported by
this foundation the revelation of the cognition of the all-knowing takes place, the revelation
of the Buddha-body, of the Dharma-body, of the Samgha-body.The acquisition of the physical
personality is thus the cause of the cognition of the all-knowing. As the sure foundation
of that cognition it has, for all beings, become a true shrine, worthy of being saluted
respectfully, of being honoured, revered and adored.After I have gone to Parinirvana,
my relics also will be worshipped.It is for this reason that the person who would copy and
worship the perfection of wisdom would beget the greater merit.For, in doing so, he would
worship the cognition of the all-knowing. (59) The son or daughter of good family who has
made a copy of the perfection of wisdom, and who worships it, would beget the greater merit.For
by worshipping the perfection of wisdom he worships the cognition of the all-knowing.

Sakra: How can it be that those men of Jambudvipa, who do not copy this perfection of wisdom,
nor take it up, nor study it, nor worship it, do not know that the Lord has taught that
the cult of the perfection of wisdom is greatly profitable! How is it that they are not aware
that the Lord has taught that the cult of the perfection of wisdom brings great advantages,
fruits and rewards! But they do not know this, they are not aware of this! They have
no faith in it! The Lord: What do you think, Kausika, how many of those men of Jambudvipa
are endowed with perfect faith in the Buddha, the Dharma, the Samgha? (60) Sakra: Only a
few.The Lord: So it is, Kausika.Only a few men of Jambudvipa are endowed with perfect faith
in the Buddha, the Dharma and the Samgha.Fewer than those few are those who attain the fruits
of a Streamwinner, and, after that, the fruit of a Once-Returner, or of a Never-Returner.Fewer
still are those who attain Arhatship.Fewer still realise Pratyekabuddha-enlightenment.Fewer
still raise their thoughts to full enlightenment.Fewer still are those who, having
raised their thoughts to full enlightenment, strengthen that thought.Fewer still those
who, having raised their thoughts to full enlightenment, and strengthened that thought,
in addition dwell with vigor exerted.Fewer still those who pursue meditation on the perfection
of wisdom.Fewer still those who course in the perfection of wisdom.Fewer still those
who, coursing and striving in the perfection of wisdom, abide on the irreversible Bodhisattva-stage.Fewer
still, coursing and striving in the perfection of wisdom, will know full
enlightenment.Fewer still, coursing and striving in the perfection of wisdom, do know full
enlightenment.Now, those Bodhisattvas who have stood on the irreversible Bodhisattva-stage,
and who have known full enlightenment, they expound the perfection of wisdom to other sons
and daughters of good family (61) who are earnestly intent, who train themselves, and
strive, in the perfection of wisdom.And they, in their turn, take up the perfection of wisdom,
studyand worship it.There are, on the other hand, countless beings who raise their thoughts
to enlightenment, who strengthen that thought of enlightenment, who course towards
enlightenment,- and perhaps just one or two of them can abide on the irreversible Bodhisattva-stage!For
full enlightenment is hard to come up to if one has inferior vigour, is slothful,
an inferior being, has inferior thoughts, notions, intentions and wisdom.So then, if
someone wants quickly to know full enlightenment, he should indefatigably and continually
hear and study this very perfection of wisdom.For he will understand that in the past, when
he was a Bodhisattva, the Tathagata trained in the perfection of wisdom;that also he should
train in it;that she is his Teacher.In any case, when the Tathagata has disappeared into
final Nirvana, the Bodhisattvas should run back to this very perfection of wisdom.(62)
Therefore then, Kausika, if someone would build, for the worship of the Tathagata who has
disappeared into final Nirvana, many kotis of Stupas made of the seven precious things, enshrining
therein the relics of the Tathagata,and all his life honor them with flowers, etc.,
would he then, on the strength of that, beget a great deal of merit? Sakra: He would,
O Lord.The Lord: Greater would be the merit of someone who would truly believe in this perfection
of wisdom; who would, trustingly, confiding in it, resolutely intent on it, serene
in his faith, his thoughts raised to enlightenment, in earnest intent, hear it, learn it,
bear it in mind, recite and study it, spread, demonstrate, explain, expound and repeat it,
illuminate it in detail to others, uncover its meaning, investigate it with his mind; who,
using his wisdom the fullest extent, would thoroughly examine it; who would copy it, and
preserve and store away the copy â€“ so that the good dharma might last long, so that the
guide of the Buddhas might not be annihilated, so that the good dharma might not disappear,so
that the Bodhisattvas, the great beings might continue to be assisted, since their guide
will not give out,- and who, finally, would honour and worship this perfection of wisdom.
(63) Greater would be the merit of the devotee of the perfection of wisdomcompared not
only with that of a person who would build many kotis of Stupas made of the seven precious
things, enshrining the relics of the Tathagata. It would be greater than the merit of one
who would completely fill the entire Jambudvipa with such Stupas.(64) It would be greater
than the merit produced by all beings in a four-continent world system if each single one
of them were to build such a Stupa.(65) Or, equally, if all beings in a small chiliocosm,(66)
or in a medium dichiliocosm,(67) or in a great trichiliocosm would do likewise.(68) Or,
if, to put an imaginary case, all beings in a great trichiliocosm should simultaneously
become human beings, and each one of them build such a Stupa; and if each one of them should
build all those Stupas, and honor them for an aeon or the remainder of an aeon;(69) still
the devotee of the perfection of wisdom would have greater merit than that which results
from the effect of the meritorious deeds of all those beings who erect and worship those
countless Stupas.

Sakra: So it is, O Lord.For the person who honours the perfection of wisdom, in an absolute
sense he honours the past, future and present Buddhas in all the world systems, which can
be comprehended only by the cognition of a Buddha.His merit will be greater even than that
of all beings in great trichiliocosms countless like the sands of the Ganges, (70) if each
single being in them would build a Stupa, and if each one of them would build all those
Stupas, and honor them for an aeon or the remainder of an aeon.
