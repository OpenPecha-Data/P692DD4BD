2. Simile of the wishing jewelIt is like a priceless jewel which has the property of preventing
men and ghosts from entering the place where it is put.If someone were possessed by a
ghost, one would only have to introduce this jewel, and that ghost would depart.If someone
were oppressed by the wind, and would apply this jewel when his body is inflated,he would
hold back that wind, would prevent it from getting worse, would appease it.It would have
a similar effect when applied to a body burning with bile,choked with phlegm,or painful as
a result of a disease arising from a disorder of the humours.(97) It would illuminate the
blackest darkness of night.In the heat it would cool the spot of earth where it is placed.In
the cold it would warm it.Its presence drives vipers and other noxious animals from districts
which they have infested.If a woman or man were bitten by a viper, one need only show
them that jewel; and its sight will counteract that poison, and make it depart.Such are
the qualities of this jewel.If one had a boil in the eye, or clouded eyesight, or a disease
in the eye, or a cataract, one need only place that jewel on the eyes, and its mere presence
will remove and appease those afflictions.Such are its qualities.Placed in water, it
dyes the water all through with its own colour.Wrapped in a white cloth, and thrown into
water, it makes the water white.Equally, when wrapped or bound in a black-blue, or yellow,
or red, or crimson cloth, or into cloth of any other colour, it would dye that water into
which it were thrown with the colour of the cloth.It would also clear up any turbidity there
might be in the water.Endowed with such qualities would that jewel be.

(98) Ananda: Do these jewels, Kausika, belong to the world of the Gods, or to the men of Jambudvipa?
Sakra: They are found among the Gods.The jewels found among the men of Jambudvipa,
on the other hand,are rather coarse and small, and not endowed with such qualities.They
are infinitely inferior to those heavenly jewels.But those among the Gods are fine and full
of all possible qualities.If that jewel were now put into a basket, or placed upon it, then
that basket would still be desirable after the jewel had again been taken out.The basket,
through the qualities of the jewel, would become an object of supreme longing.In the same
way, O Lord, the qualities of the cognition of the all-knowing are derived from the perfection
of wisdom.On account of it the relics of the Tathagata who has gone to Parinirvana
are worshipped. For they are the true repositories of the cognition of the all-knowing.And
as the demonstration of dharma by the Buddhas and Lords in all world systems should be
worshipped because it has come forth from the perfection of wisdom, so also the dharma-preacherâ€™s
demonstration of dharma.As a king should be worshipped, because his royal might gives
courage to a great body of people, (99) so also the preacher of dharma, because, through
the might of the Dharma-body, he gives courage to a great body of people.But the relics
of the Tathagata are worshipped for the same reason that one worships the demonstration of
dharma, and the preacher of dharma.
