5. Right attitude to perfect wisdomSubhuti: How does the development of perfect wisdom, on the
part of a Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom, become increasingly perfect? The Lord:
A Bodhisattva courses in perfect wisdom when he reviews neither the growth nor the diminution
of form, etc.,when he does not review either dharmaor no-dharma.It is thus that his
development of perfect wisdom becomes increasingly perfect.

Subhuti: This explanation is surely unthinkable.The Lord: Because form is unthinkable,and so
are the other skandhas.When he does not even perceive that form, etc., are unthinkable, then
he courses in perfect wisdom.

(220) Sariputra: Who will zealously believe in this so deep perfection of wisdom? The Lord:
A Bodhisattva who is practised in perfect wisdom.Sariputra: How does a Bodhisattva become
practised, and what is the meaning of the word ‘practised’? The Lord: Here a Bodhisattva does
not construct the powers, nor the grounds of self-confidence, nor the Buddha-dharmas,
nor even the state of all-knowledge.Because the powers are unthinkable, and so are the grounds
of self-confidence, so are the Buddha-dharmas, so is the state of all-knowledge, and
so are all dharmas.When, thus practised, a Bodhisattva does not course anywhere, then he courses
in perfect wisdom.For that reason is he called ‘practised,’ and that is the meaning
of the word ‘practised.’
