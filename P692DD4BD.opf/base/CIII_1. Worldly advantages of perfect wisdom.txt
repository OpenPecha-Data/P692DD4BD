1. Worldly advantages of perfect wisdomThe Lord saw that the Gods were assembled and seated,
and that the monks, nuns, laymen and laywomen were assembled and seated, and he spoke thus
to the Gods: Mara and his hosts will be unable to harm those who take up this perfection
of wisdom, who bear it in mind, preach, study and spread it.Men and ghosts alike will be
unable to harm them.Nor will they die an untimely death.

Those deities who have set out for full enlightenment, but who have not yet got hold of this
perfection of wisdom, will approach a person who has (50) done so, listen to him, and will
also take up, etc., this perfection of wisdom.A person who is devoted to this perfection
of wisdom will certainly experience no fear, he will certainly never be stiff with fright,
- whether he be in a forest, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty shed, or an open place,
or a road, or a highway, or the woods, or on the ocean.

The Four Great Kings: It is wonderful, O Lord, that those who take up, etc., this perfection
of wisdom should discipline beings in the three vehicles, and yet not perceive any being.We,
O Lord, will protect such a person.

(51) Sakra, Brahman and other Gods likewise promised to protect the follower of perfect wisdom.

Sakra: It is wonderful, O Lord, that by taking up, etc., this perfection of wisdom, one should
gain so many advantages even here and now. Does one, when taking up the perfection of wisdom,
take up all the six perfections? The Lord: Yes.And further, by taking up, etc., the
perfection of wisdom, one gains advantages even here and now.Listen attentively, and I will
teach you which ones they are.So be it, Lord, replied the Gods.The Lord: The quarrels,
contentions and contradictions of those who oppose my dharma will simply vanish away;the intentions
of the opponents will remain unfulfilled.(52) Because it is a fact that for the
followers of perfect wisdom those disputes will simply vanish away, and will not abide.This
is one advantage even here and now.There is a herb, Maghi by name, a cure for all poison.Suppose
a viper, famished, were to see a creature,and pursue it, following the scent, in
order to eat it;but if that creature went to a patch of that herb and stood there,then the
smell of that herb would cause the snake to turn back.Because the healing quality of that
herb is so powerful that it overpowers the viper’s poison.Just so will the quarrels, contentions
and contradictions to which the follower of perfect wisdom is exposed, be stilled,
be appeased, (53) through the piercing flame of perfect wisdom, through its power, its strength,
through impregnation with its power.They will vanish, and not grow, nor abide.And
why? Because it is perfect wisdom which appeases all evil, - from [ordinary] greed to seizing
on Nirvana – and does not increase it.And the Gods and all the Buddhas, and all the Bodhisattvas,
will protect this follower of perfect wisdom.This will be an advantage even here
and now.

And further, the speech of the follower of perfect wisdom will become acceptable, soft, measured
and adequate. Wrath and conceit will not overpower him.Because perfect wisdom tames and
transforms him. Wrath and conceit he does not increase.Neither enmity nor ill will take
hold of him, not even a tendency towards them.(54) He will be mindful and friendly.He reflects:
‘If I foster ill will in myself, my faculties will go to pieces, my features will be
consumed,and it is, in any case, quite illogical that I, who have set out for full enlightenment,
and who want to train myself for it, should come under the sway of wrath.’In this
way he will quickly regain his mindfulness.This will be another advantage even here and
now.Sakra: It is wonderful how this perfection of wisdom has been set up for the control and
training of the Bodhisattvas.

The Lord: And further, Kausika, if a follower of perfect wisdom were to go into battle, to the
very front of it,he could not possibly lose his life in it.It is impossible that he should
lose his life from the attack of somebody else.(55) If someone strikes at him, - with
sword, or stick, or clod of earth, or anything else – his body cannot be hit.Because a great
lore is this, the perfection of wisdom;a lore without measure,a quite measureless lore,an
unsurpassed lore,a lore which equals the unequalled is this, the perfection of wisdom.Because
when one trains oneself in this lore, then one is intent neither on disturbing one’s
own peace, nor that of others.The Bodhisattva, the great being who is trained in this lore,
will reach full enlightenment, will gain the gnosis of the all-knowing.Once fully enlightened
he will read the thoughts of all beings.Because to the Bodhisattvas, the great beings
who are trained in this lore, nothing remains unattained, unknown, unrealized.That is
why one speaks of the gnosis of the all-knowing.This is another advantage even here and now.

(56) Further, where this perfection of wisdom has been written down in a book, and has been
put up and worshipped, where it has been taken up, etc., there men and ghosts can do no harm,
except as a punishment for past deeds.This is another advantage even here and now.

Just, Kausika, as those men and ghosts who have gone to the terrace of enlightenment, or to
its neighbourhood, or its interior, or to the foot of the tree of enlightenment, cannot be
hurt by men or ghosts, or be injured by them, or taken possession of, even with the help
of evil animal beings, except as a punishment for former deeds.Because in it the past, future,
and present Tathagatas win their enlightenment, they who promote in all beings and who
reveal to them fearlessness, lack of hostility, lack of fright.Just so Kausika, the place
in which one takes up, etc., this perfection of wisdom, in it beings cannot be hurt by men
or ghosts.(57) Because this perfection of wisdom makes the spot of earth where it is into
a true shrine for beings, - worthy of being worshipped and adored, - into a shelter for
beings who come to it, a refuge, a place to rest and final relief.This is another advantage
even here and now.
