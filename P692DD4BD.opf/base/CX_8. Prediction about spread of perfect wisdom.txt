8. Prediction about spread of perfect wisdomMoreover, these Sutras associated with the six perfections
will, after the passing away of the Tathagata, appear in the South. From the South
they will spread to the East, and from there to the North- from the time when the Dharma-Vinaya
is like freshly made cream right into the period when the good law disappears.Those
who at that time study and preserve this perfection of wisdom will be brought to mind
by the Tathagata; the Tathagata will know,sustainand see them,and behold them with his Buddha-eye.

Sariputra: Will even this so deep perfection of wisdom in the last time, in the last period,
be widespread in the northern direction, in the northern part of the world? The Lord: Those
who, in the North, will make efforts in this deep perfection of wisdom after they have
heard it, (226) they will make it widespread.As set out for long in the vehicle should the
Bodhisattvas be known who will study this perfection of wisdom then.
