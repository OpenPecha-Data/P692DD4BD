3. Dharmodgata’s demonstration of dharmaAfter the lapse of seven years the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata
emerged from his trance, went up to the seat spread out for him, sat down on it, and,
surrounded and attended by an assembly of many hundreds of thousands, he demonstrated dharma.

The moment the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita (525) saw the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata, he was filled
with that kind of happiness which a monk feels when, with one-pointed attention, he has
obtained the first trance.And this is the demonstration of the perfection of wisdom by the
Bodhisattva Dharmodgata: “The perfection of wisdom is self-identical, because all dharmas
are the same.Perfect wisdom is isolated because all dharmas are isolated.Perfect wisdom is
immobile because all dharmas are immobile.Perfect wisdom is devoid of mental acts because
all dharmas are devoid of mental acts.Perfect wisdom is unbenumbed, because all dharmas
are unbenumbed.Perfect wisdom has but one single taste because all dharmas have one and the
same taste.Perfect wisdom is boundless because all dharmas are boundless.Perfect wisdom
is non-production because all dharmas are non-production.Perfect wisdom is non-stopping because
all dharmas are not stopped.As the firmament is boundless, so is perfect wisdom.As the
ocean is boundless, so is perfect wisdom.As Meru shines in multicoloured brilliance, so
does the perfection of wisdom.As the firmament is not fashioned, so is perfect wisdom not
fashioned.Perfect wisdom is boundless, because form, and the other skandhas are boundless.Perfect
wisdom is boundless because the element of earth, and the other elements, are boundless.Perfect
wisdom is self-identical, because the adamantine dharma is self-identical.Perfect
wisdom is undifferentiated because all dharmas are undifferentiated.The non-apprehension
of perfect wisdom follows from the non-apprehension of all dharmas.Perfect wisdom remains
the same whatever it may surpass because all dharmas remain the same whatever they may
surpass.(526) Perfect wisdom is powerless to act because all dharmas are powerless to act.Perfect
wisdom is unthinkable because all dharmas are unthinkable.”

Thereupon on that occasion there was born in the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita the king of concentrations
called “the sameness of all dharmas,”and, consequent on that, the concentrations
called “isolation of all dharmas,” “immobility of all dharmas,” “absence of all mental acts
in all dharmas,” “lack of numbness in all dharmas,” “the one taste of all dharmas,” “the
boundlessness of all dharmas,” "the non-production of all dharmas," "the non-stopping of
all dharmas," “boundless like the firmament,” “boundless like the ocean,” “brilliant and
multicoloured like Meru,” “not fashioned, like the firmament,” “boundless like form, etc.,”
“boundless like the element of earth, etc.,” “adamantine,” “non-differentiatedness of all
dharmas,” “non-apprehension of all dharmas,” “sameness of all dharmas whatever they may
surpass,” “all dharmas are powerless to act,” “all dharmas are unthinkable.”Beginning with
these, the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita acquired six million concentration doors.
