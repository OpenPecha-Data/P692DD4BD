3. Five similes to illustrate nearness to full enlightenmentSariputra: A simile or example flashes
into my mind, O Lord.Just as we can be sure that a person belonging to the vehicle
of the Bodhisattvas, when he dreams that he sits on the terrace of enlightenment, is actually
near to supreme enlightenment;just so we can be sure that a person who fulfils the conditions
just outlined has come from afar, has set out for long in the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas,and
is near his prediction to enlightenment.We can be sure that the Buddhas, the Lords,
will predict (215) that this Bodhisattva shall win full enlightenment.For a Bodhisattva
has set out for long in the vehicle, and his wholesome roots are mature, if he gets to
this deep perfection of wisdom, even if he gets no further than hearing it.How much more
so if he would also bear it in mind, etc., to: repeat it.For the thoughts of beings who are
not without an abundance of accumulations of karma conducive to the ruin of dharma will
become averse to this deep perfection of wisdom, will sway away from it.Through the abundance
of that karma beings who have not collected wholesome roots will find no satisfaction
nor faith in this reality-limit.But those who find satisfaction and faith in it are people
who have collected wholesome roots, well collected them.A man coming out of a huge wild forest,
one hundred miles big, up to a thousand miles big,might see certain signs which indicate
a town, or other inhabited place, - such as cowherds, or cattle keepers, or boundary
lines, or gardens, or groves.(216) From those signs he will infer the nearness of an inhabited
place.He feels happier,and robbers no longer worry him.Just so a Bodhisattva for whom
this deep perfection of wisdom turns up should know that he is quite near to supreme enlightenment,
that before long he will receive the prediction to it.He should also no longer
be afraid of the level of the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas.For this sign has appeared to
him, i.e., that he has received this deep perfection of wisdom for vision, praise, worship,
and hearing.The Lord: So it is, Sariputra.May you make clear also this section. For what
you say, and what you will say, is due to the Buddha’s might.

Sariputra: A man, desirous of seeing the great ocean,might travel to it.As long as on his travels
he sees a tree, or the sign of a tree, a mountain, or the sign of a mountain, he knows
that the great ocean is still far away.But when he no longer sees either tree or mountain,
then he knows that the great ocean is quite near from there.For this great ocean gradually
slopes away, and within it there is neither tree nor mountain.(217) And although he may
not yet see the great ocean directly before his eyes, he nevertheless can be quite certain
that the ocean is quite near, not much farther away from there.Similar is the case of
the Bodhisattva who has heard this deep perfection of wisdom. He knows that, although he has
not yet, face to face with these Tathagatas, been predicted to supreme enlightenment, nevertheless
he is quite near that prediction.For he has received this deep perfection of wisdom,
for vision, praise, worship and hearing.In spring, O Lord, when last year’s leaves
have withered away, one can see sproutings on many trees.The men of Jambudvipa will then be
glad, because when they have seen these symptoms in the woods, they know that soon also
flowers and fruits will come out.For they have seen these signs on the trees.Just so, O Lord,
one can be sure that a Bodhisattva, when he receives this deep perfection of wisdom, when
it turns up for him,that he has matured his wholesome roots for a long time. It is just
because of the existence of these wholesome roots in him that this deep perfection of wisdom
has bent over to him.Then those divinities who have seen the Buddhas of the past are
delighted, overjoyed and enchanted, because they feel that surely it will not be long before
this Bodhisattva will receive his prediction to full enlightenment, since also with the
Bodhisattvas of the past these were the symptoms of their coming prediction to full enlightenment.(218)
A woman, pregnant with a heavy womb,is twisted, and all weary, she does not
walk about a great deal,takes little food,finds little rest,speaks little,has little strengthbut
many pains,often cries out aloudand abstains from habitual cohabitation.She realises
that she experiences all these unpleasant feelings in her body as a result of indulging
in unwise attention in the past, practising it, developing it, making much of it. When these
symptoms are seen in her, one can be sure that before long she will give birth to a child.Just
so, when for a Bodhisattva this deep perfection of wisdom turns up for the sake of
vision, praise, worship, and hearing, and if, when he hears it, his thought delights in
it, and he becomes desirous of it, then one can be sure that before long he will receive the
prediction to full enlightenment.
