2. Description of Gandhavati, and of Dharmodgata’s lifeWhen Sadaprarudita thus sorrowed and
pined away, a Tathagata-frame [suddenly] stood before him, gave his approval and said: Well
spoken, son of good family!For the Tathagatas of the past, when they were Bodhisattvas,
have also searched for perfect wisdom in the same spirit in which you just now search for
it.In this same spirit of vigour and determination, of zeal and zest, - do you go East!There,
five hundred leagues away from here, is a town called Gandhavati. It is built of the seven
precious things. It is twelve leagues long and twelve leagues broad, and enclosed by
seven walls, seven moats and seven rows of palm trees. It is prosperous and flourishing, secure
from attack, contains abundant provisions and is full of beasts and men. Five hundred
rows of shops run through the town from one end to the other, beautiful to behold like a
well-coloured painting, arranged one by one in regular succession, and in between them well-constructed
sites and passages are erected, respectively for vehicles drawn by animals,
for palanquins, and for pedestrians, so that there is plenty of room for all.The walls all
round that town are made of the seven precious substances.(486) Their well-founded copings
slope into the golden river Jambu.And on each coping grows a tree, made of the seven precious
things, laden with various fruits, also made of precious things. All around, between
each tree and the next, hangs a string, also made of precious substances.A network of small
bells in fastened on the strings,and thus surrounds the entire city.When stirred by the
wind, the small bells give out a sweet, charming and delightful sound,just like the sound
from the five musical instruments when they are played in harmony by the Gandharvas, skilled
in songs.And that sound causes those beings to divert, enjoy and amuse themselves.The
moats all around the city are full of water which flows gently along, neither too cold nor
too hot.The boats on that river are brilliant with the seven precious things, beautiful
to behold, and their existence is a reward of the past deeds of the inhabitants who, aboard
them, divert, enjoy and amuse themselves.The water is everywhere covered with blossoms of
the blue lotus, of the pink lotus, of the white lotus, and with other most beautiful and
fragrant flowers.There is no species of flowers in the great trichiliocosm that is not found
there.All around that city there are five hundred parks,beautiful to behold, brilliant
with the seven precious things.(487) Each park has five times five hundred large lotus ponds,covered
with beautiful blossoms,each of the size of a cartwheel, fragrant, - blue, yellow,
red and white.The sounds of geese, cranes, ducks, curlews and other birds fill the air
over the ponds.And the existence of those parks which they do not regard as their own private
property is a reward for the past deeds of those beings, for they had coursed for a
long time in the perfection of wisdom, their minds faithfully devoted to the Guide of the
Buddhas and bent on listening to her and understanding her, and for a long time they had been
intent on deep dharmas.And there, in that city of Gandhavati, at a place where four roads
meet, is the house of the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata, - one league all round,bright with
the seven precious things, beautiful to behold,enclosed by seven walls and seven rows of palm
trees.There are four parks near the house, for the enjoyment of those who live in it.They
are called Nityapramudita,Asoka, Sokavigata, and Pushpacitra.Each park has eight lotus
ponds, called Bhadra, Bhadrottama, Nandi, Nandottama, Kshama, Kshamottama, Niyata and Avivaha.One
side of each pond is of gold, the second of silver, (488) the third of vaidurya,
the fourth of crystal.The ground at the bottom consists of quartz, with golden sand over it.Each
pond has eight stairs to it, decorated with steps, made of variegated jewels.In the
gaps between the steps, inside the golden river Jambu, grows a plantain tree.The ponds are
covered with various kinds of water flowers, and the air above them is filled with the sounds
of various birds.Round these ponds grow various flowering trees,and when they are stirred
by the wind, their flowers drop into the ponds.The water in the ponds has the scent,
colour, taste and feel of sandalwood.In this mansion lives the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata, with
his retinue, among them sixty-eight thousand women. He diverts, enjoys and amuses himself,
he feels and tastes the five kinds of sense-pleasure.All the inhabitants of that city,
both women and men, divert, enjoy and amuse themselves, they have constant joy in the parks
and on the ponds and they feel and taste the five kinds of sense-pleasure.The Bodhisattva
Dharmodgata, however, with his retinue, diverts, enjoys and amuses himself only for a
certain time, and thereafter he always demonstrates the perfection of wisdom.And the citizens
of that town built a pulpit for the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata in the central square of the
town. It has a golden base, then a cotton mattress is spread on that, then a woollen cover,
a cushion and a silken cloth are put on top of that.High up in the air, half a Kos high,
there is an awning, shining with pearls, even and firm.All (489) round that pulpit flowers
of the five colours are strewed and scattered, and the pulpit itself is scented with
various perfumes.So pure is the heart of Dharmodgata, so great the respect of his hearers
for dharma.Seated on that pulpit the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata demonstrates the perfection of
wisdom.The citizens of that town listen to his teaching with great respect for dharma, with
trust in dharma, with faith in what is worthy of faith, with minds that are lifted up
in faith.In addition many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of living beings,
Gods and men, assemble there to listen.Some of them explain the perfection of wisdom,
some repeat it, some copy it, some follow it with wise attention.All those beings are no
longer doomed to fall into the states of woe, and they are irreversible from full enlightenment.Son
of good family, go to that Bodhisattva Dharmodgata!From him you shall hear the
perfection of wisdom.For he has been for a long time your good friend, he has summoned, instigated
and encouraged you to win full enlightenment.He also has, in the past, searched
for the perfection of wisdom in the same way in which just now you search for it.Go forth,
son of good family, go on day and night, giving your undivided attention to the task! Before
long you shall hear the perfection of wisdom!

When the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita had heard this, he became contented, elated, joyful, overjoyed
and jubilant.(490) A man, hit with a poisoned arrow, could not think of anything else
except: “Where shall I find a surgeon, a skilled physician, who can pull out this arrow,
and free me from this suffering.”Just so the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita at that time pays
no attention to any dharma except: ”When then shall I see that son of good family from whom
I shall hear the perfection of wisdom? When I have heard that dharma, I shall forsake all
attentions to a basis.”

Without leaving the place where he was Sadaprarudita then heard the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata
demonstrating the perfection of wisdom.
