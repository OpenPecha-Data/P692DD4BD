3. More tokens of irreversibilityFurthermore, an irreversible Bodhisattva is one who has turned
away from the level of Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas, and who has proceeded in the direction
of all-knowledge.According to plan he enters into the first,second, third and fourth
trance, and he dwells in those four trances.He becomes a complete master over the trances,
i.e. he enters into the trances, but his future rebirth is not determined by their influence.It
is on the dharmas of the sphere of sense-desire that he bases his rebirth.This also
should be known as a mark of irreversibility in an irreversible Bodhisattva.

Furthermore, an irreversible Bodhisattva does not attach weight to a name, nor to renown, title
or fame. He does not get attached to a [particular] name [which in any case is absent
in emptiness].His mind remains undismayed, and interested only in the welfare of all beings.Whether
he goes out or comes back, his mind does not wander,and he remains ever mindful.When
he lives the life of a householder, he has no great love for pleasant things, and he
does not want them too much.With fear and disgust he possesses all pleasant things.Situated
in a wilderness infested with robbers one would eat one’s meals in fear, and with the constant
thought (333) of getting away, of getting out of this wilderness, and not with repose.Just
so an irreversible Bodhisattva who lives the life of a householder, possesses any
pleasant things he may have simply without caring for them, without eagerness, without attachment.He
is not one of those people who care for dear and pleasant forms.Those who live
the lives of householders and who are involved in the five kinds of sensuous pleasures do
not earn their living in an irregular way,but in the right way.Neither do they incur death
in a state of sin, nor do they inflict injuries on others.For they have incited all beings
to win the supreme happiness, - those worthy men, those great men, supermen, excellent men,
splendid men, bulls of men, sublime men, valiant men, heroes of men, leaders of men, waterlilies
of men, lotuses of men, thoroughbred men, Nagas of men, lions of men, trainers
of men!It is in this spirit that Bodhisattvas live the life of householders, inasmuch as they
have been impregnated with the power of the perfection of wisdom,- and that is another
token of their irreversibility.

Furthermore, Vajrapani, the great Yaksha, constantly follows behind the irreversible Bodhisattva.Unassailable,
the Bodhisattva cannot be defeated by either men or ghosts. All beings
find it hard to conquer him, and his mind is not disturbed [by their attacks].His faculties
are all complete, and he is not deficient in any.He possesses the organs of a virile man,
(334) not those of an impotent man.He does not in any way embark on those spells, mutterings,
herbs, magical formulae, medical incantations, etc., which are the work of women.He
earns his livelihood in a clean way, not in a wrong way.His character is neither quarrelsome
nor disputatious.His views are upright,he does not exalt himself nor deprecate others.With
these and other similar qualities he is endowed.He does not predict to women or men that
they will have a son or a daughter.Such faulty ways of making himself acceptable will not
be his.All this is another token of irreversibility.

Furthermore, Subhuti, I will demonstrate the attributes, tokens and signs of an irreversible
Bodhisattva. Endowed with them he would be known as irreversible from full enlightenment.Again,
which are they? The following: He does not give himself over to occupation and preoccupation
with the skandhas, the sense-fields, the elements, and with conditioned coproduction.
He is not preoccupied with the kind of talk one is fond of in society, with talk about
kings, and robbers, about armies and battles; about villages, (335) cities, market towns,
countries, kingdoms, and capitals; about himself, about ministers and prime ministers;
about women, men and neuters; about journeys, parks, monasteries, palaces, pools, lakes, ponds,
lotus ponds, woods, gardens and mountains; about Yakshas, Rakshasas, Pretas, Pishacas,
Kataputana-demons and Kumbhanda-demons; about food, drink, dresses, ornaments, perfumes,
garlands and ointments; about roads, crossroads, streets, markets, palanquins and people;
about songs, dances, tales, actors, dancers, and wandering singers; about the ocean, about
rivers, about islands. They do not devote themselves to talk which obstructs dharma, to
the kind of talk which delights the common people, but to talk on the perfection of wisdom,and
they become people who do not lack in the mental activities which are associated with
all-knowledge.But talk about fightings and strife, about quarrels and disputes they avoid.They
are willing for what is right, and not willing for what is wrong.They praise without
causing dissension, and not in order to cause dissension.They want friendship, and not its
opposite.They preach dharma, and not its opposite.They plan to gain a vision of those Tathagatas
who dwell in other world systems, and thus they produce a thought which leads them
to rebirth in their presence.According to plan they are reborn near them,and so they do
not lack in the vision of the Tathagatas, (336) nor in opportunities for honouring and serving
them.

Furthermore, when an irreversible Bodhisattva has definitely terminated his existence among
the Gods, - whether they belong to the sphere of sense-desire, or the sphere of form, or the
formless sphere, - he is reborn in just this middle region, in Jambudvipa.For in the border
countries there are only a few beings with a good knowledge of the arts, of poetry, of
mantras, of secret lore, of the standard treatises, of portents and of the meaning of religion,but
in the middle region they are reborn in abundance.But those who are reborn in the
border regions are at least reborn in the big towns.This is another mark of irreversibility.

Furthermore, to an irreversible Bodhisattva it does not occur to ask himself whether he is irreversible
or not.No doubt about it arises in him, he has no uncertainty about the stage
he has made his own, and he does not sink down below it.Just as a Streamwinner has no hesitations
or doubts about the fruit of a Streamwinner, if that is the stage which is his by
right, just so an irreversible Bodhisattva has no hesitations or doubts about being on the
stage of a Bodhisattva, when that stage is his by right,he has no uncertainties about the
stage which is his by right,nor does he sink below it.And he quickly sees through any deed
of Mara that may have arisen,and does not come under his sway.(337) A man who has committed
one of the deadly sins will never again, until his death, lose the thought of that action,
he cannot get rid of it or remove it,but it follows after him until the time of his death.Just
so the irreversible mind of an irreversible Bodhisattva has learned to stand firm
on the irreversible stage which is his by right,and even the whole world, with its Gods,
men and Asuras, cannot deflect, divert or diverge him from it.He recognizes any deeds of
Mara that may have arisen for what they are,and does not come under their sway.He is free
from hesitations and doubts about the stage which is his by right, and even after he has passed
through this present life the thoughts which are characteristic of Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas
will not arise in him.But when he has passed through this present life he will
think: “It is not the case that I shall not win full enlightenment.I am sure to win full
enlightenment, I who have stood firm on the stage which is mine by right.”He can no longer
be led astray by others, and on the stage which is his by right he cannot be crushed.For,
as he has stood firm on it, his mind becomes insuperable, his cognition becomes insuperable.Suppose
that Mara, the Evil One, in the guise of the Buddha himself were to come to him,
and say: “Realize Arhatship in this very life!You are not predestined to full enlightenment.You
have not the attributes, tokens and signs with which a Bodhisattva must be endowed
in order to win full enlightenment.Why then should you course in this?” If the Bodhisattva
then experiences a change of heart, one should know that he has not been predicted to full
enlightenment by the Tathagatas in the past.(338) If, on the other hand, he considers
that “this, surely, is Mara, the Evil One, who has come along after he has, by magical means,
adopted the disguise of the Buddha, I am beset by Mara, this is one of Mara’s magical
creations, but not the Tathagata.The Tathagata has spoken to the effect that one should not
realize Arhatship, and not otherwise,”if he sees and understands that “this, surely, is
Mara, the Evil One, who has manufactured a magical double of the appearance of the Buddha,
and who wants to estrange me from supreme enlightenment,”and if Mara, after that, turns back,
then this Bodhisattva has certainly in the past been predicted to full enlightenment
by the Tathagatas,and he has stood firmly in the irreversible Bodhisattva-stage.Where these
attributes, tokens and signs are found in a Bodhisattva, there one can be certain, beyond
any shadow of doubt,that, as he has those qualities, he has been predicted by the Tathagatas
in the past,and has stood firm on the irreversible Bodhisattva-stage.For he has the attributes,
tokens and signs of an irreversible Bodhisattva.This is another token of irreversibility.

Furthermore, an irreversible Bodhisattva tries to gain the good dharma even if it costs him
his life and all his belongings.Therefore he makes a supreme effort to gain the good dharma,
through his affection and respect for the Buddhas and Lords, past, future and present.In
the conviction that “the Dharma-bodies are the Buddhas, the Lords” (339) he wins the good
dharma through his affection and respect for Dharma.He gains the good dharma not only of
the past Buddhas and Lords, but also of the present and future Buddhas and Lords. He becomes
convinced that he also has joined the ranks of those who are reckoned as future Buddhas
and Lords, that he also has been predicted to that supreme enlightenment, that also he will
gain just this good dharma.Also these considerations he bears in mind when, in his efforts
to gain the good dharma, he renounces even his life and all his belongings,when he does
not lose heart, or becomes indolent.This is another token of irreversibility.

Moreover, when the Tathagata demonstrates dharma, an irreversible Bodhisattva does not hesitate
or doubt.Subhuti: Does he also not hesitate or doubt when a Disciple demonstrates dharma?
The Lord: No, he does not.For a Bodhisattva who has acquired the patient acceptance of
dharmas which fail to be produceddoes not hesitate or doubt when he hears about the unobstructed
true nature of all dharmas.Endowed with these virtues a Bodhisattva becomes irreversible.(340)
These also should be known as the attributes, tokens and signs of a Bodhisattva
who is irreversible from full enlightenment.
