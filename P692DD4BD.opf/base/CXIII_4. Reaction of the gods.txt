4. Reaction of the godsThereupon the Gods of the realm of sense-desire and of the realm of form
said to the Lord: Deep, O Lord, is the perfection of wisdom, hard to see, hard to understand.(283)
Bodhisattvas who resolutely believe in this so deep perfection of wisdom must
have fulfilled their duties under the Jinas of the past, must have planted wholesome roots
for a long time.If, O Lord, all the beings in this great trichiliocosm should, for an aeon
or the remainder of an aeon, course on the stage of a Faith-follower; and if, on the other
hand, someone should, for one day only, find pleasure in the patient acceptance of this
deep perfection of wisdom, and should search for it, reflect on it, weigh it up, investigate
it and meditate on it, then this latter will be better than all those beings.The Lord:
If someone would hear, O Gods, this deep perfection of wisdom, etc., then one would expect
his Nirvana to take place more quickly than that of those who course on the stage of a
faith-follower for an aeon, or for the remainder of an aeon.The Gods: A great perfection is
this perfection of wisdom!– After these words, they saluted the Lord’s feet with their heads,
thrice walked round the Lord, decided to go away from the presence of the Lord, took
friendly leave of him, and moved away.Before they had gone far, they disappeared from sight,and
the Gods of the realm of sense-desire departed for the world of sense-desire, and the
Gods of the realm of form departed for the Brahma-world.
