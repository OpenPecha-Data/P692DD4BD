7. ConfirmationThereupon the Gods around Indra, Brahma and Prajapati, and the hosts of men and
women around the Rishis thrice shouted forth in triumph: Hail the Dharma! Hail the Dharma!
Hail the Dharmahood of Dharma!And they added: Beautifully has Subhuti the Elder just now
indicated, demonstrated, shown and clarified how a Tathagata comes to be manifest.As a
potential Tathagata we shall henceforth regard that Bodhisattva who possesses the fullness
of this perfection of wisdom and who dwells in it.

The Lord then said: So it is, O Gods!So did I, when I met the Tathagata Dipankara in the bazaar
of Dipavati, the royal city, possess the fulness of this perfection of wisdom, so that
Dipankara, the Tathagata, predicted that one day I should be fully enlightened, and said
to me: “You, young Brahmin, shall in a future period, after incalculable aeons, become a Tathagata,
Sakyamuni by name, - endowed with knowledge and virtue, Well-Gone, a world-knower,
unsurpassed, tamer of men to be tamed, teacher of Gods and men, a Buddha, a Blessed Lord!”The
Gods replied: It is wonderful, O Lord, it is exceedingly wonderful, O Well-Gone,how
much all-knowledge is nourished and promoted in the Bodhisattvas, the great beings, by this
perfection of wisdom!
