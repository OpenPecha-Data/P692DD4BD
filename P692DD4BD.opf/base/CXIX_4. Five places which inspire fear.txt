4. Five places which inspire fearWhile he courses thus, he is not afraid.He is impregnated with
the strength that he has gained [in his coursings in the baseless], and that enables him
to persist in his endeavours and to think: “It is not the case that I shall not be fully
enlightened.”If he courses thus, then he courses in perfect wisdom.

Moreover a Bodhisattva is not afraid when he gets into a wilderness infested with wild beasts.For
it is his duty to renounce everything for the sake of all beings.Therefore he should
react with the thought: “If these wild beasts should devour me, then just that will be my
gift to them.The perfection of giving will become more perfect in me,and I will come nearer
to full enlightenment.And after I have won full enlightenment I will take steps so that
in my Buddha-field there will be no animals at all, that one will have even no conception
of them, but that all beings in it will live on heavenly food.”

Moreover, a Bodhisattva should not be afraid if he finds himself in a wilderness infested by
robbers.For Bodhisattvas take pleasure in the wholesome practice of renouncing all their
belongings.A Bodhisattva must cast away even his body, and he must renounce all that is necessary
to life.He should react to the danger with the thought (362,1): “If those beings take
away from me everything that is necessary to life, then let that be my gift to them.If
someone should rob me of my life, I should feel no ill will, anger or fury on account of
that.Even against them I should take no offensive action, either by body, voice, or mind.This
will be an occasion to bring the perfections of giving, morality and patience to greater
perfection,and I will get nearer to full enlightenment.After I have won full enlightenment,
I will act and behave in such a manner that in my Buddha-field wilderness infested with
robbers will in no way whatsoever either be, or even be conceivable.And my exertions to
bring about perfect purity in that Buddha-field will be so great that in it neither these
nor other faults will exists, or even be conceivable.”

Furthermore, in a waterless waste also a Bodhisattva should not be afraid.For his character
is such that he is not alarmed or terrified.He should resolve that his own training might
result in removing all thirst from all beings.He should not tremble when he thinks that,if
he dies from thirst, he will be reborn as a Preta.On the contrary, he should direct a thought
of great compassion unto all beings, and think (363,1): “Alas, certainly those beings
must be of small merit if in their world such deserts are conceivable.After I have won enlightenment,
I will see to it that in my Buddha-field no such deserts exist, or are even conceivable.And
I will bestow on all beings so much merit that they shall have the most excellent
water.Thus will I exert firm vigour on behalf of all beings, so that on that occasion
also the perfection of vigour shall become more perfect in me.”

Furthermore, in a foodless waste also a Bodhisattva should not be afraid.He should arm himself
with the thought: “I will exert firm vigour, I will purify my own Buddha-field in such
a way that, after I have won enlightenment, in that Buddha-field there will be no foodless
wastes, and none will be even conceivable.The beings in that field shall be entirely happy,
filled with happiness, possessed of all happiness.And thus will I act that all the intentions
and plans of those beings shall be realised. Just as with the Gods of the Thirty-three
an idea in their minds is sufficient to produce anything they may desire, so I will exert
firm vigour so that those beings can realize and produce everything by merely thinking
of it in their minds.In order that their legitimate intentions should be fulfilled, in order
that all beings, everywhere and anywhere, should not go short of the requirements of life,
(364) I will so struggle for perfect purity in my own thought, for the sake of all beings,
that on that occasion also the perfection of concentration will become more perfect
in me.

Furthermore, a Bodhisattva will not be afraid in a district infested by epidemics.But he should
consider, reflect and deliberate that ‘there is no dharma here which sickness could oppress,
nor is that which is called ‘sickness’ a dharma.”In that manner he should contemplate
emptiness,and he should not be afraid.But he should not think that “it will be an excessively
long time before I shall win full enlightenment,” and he should not tremble at such
a thought.For that thought-moment [which in reality has not been produced] is the extreme
limit of something which has no beginning; in other words, it is the absence of a limit.A
Bodhisattva should therefore avoid dwelling in his mind on difficulties, and he should think
that “great and long is this limit which has no beginning, for it is connected with one
single thought-moment, in other words, it is the absence of a limit.”This will prevent a
Bodhisattva from trembling at the thought that it will be long before he will win full enlightenment.Moreover,
Subhuti, if these and other fears and terrors, be they seen, heard,
felt or known, do not cause a Bodhisattva to tremble, then one should know that “this son
or daughter of good family is capable of knowing full enlightenment.”A Bodhisattva should
therefore put on the great armour of the thought (365,1): “Thus will I act, thus will I exert
firm vigour that, after I have won full enlightenment, all beings in my Buddha-field shall
not suffer from sickness, and shall not even know what it is.I will act in such a way
that I shall preach what the Tathagatas have taught, and that I will do what I have preached.And
I will so master the perfection of wisdom, for the sake of all beings, that on that
occasion also the perfection of wisdom will in me come to fulfillment.”
