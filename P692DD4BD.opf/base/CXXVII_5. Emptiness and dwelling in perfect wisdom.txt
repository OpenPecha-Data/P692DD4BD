5. Emptiness and dwelling in perfect wisdomSakra: Deep, O Lord, is the perfection of wisdom.Doers
of what is hard are the Bodhisattvas who want to know full enlightenment.For, indeed,
no dharma stands in Suchness, no dharma knows full enlightenment, no one demonstrates dharma.And
yet that does not cow them, nor do they hesitate, nor are they stupefied.

Subhuti: You say, Kausika, that “doers of what is hard are the Bodhisattvas who, when dharmas
as deep as these are being taught,feel neither hesitation nor stupefaction.”But, where all
dharmas are empty who can therein feel hesitation or stupefaction? Sakra: Whatever the
holy Subhuti may expound, that he expounds with reference to emptiness, and he does not get
stuck anywhere.The holy Subhuti’s demonstration of dharma does not get stuck anywhere, no
more than an arrow shot into the air.

Then perhaps, O Lord, I, if I take into consideration Subhuti the Elder, as he thus teaches
and expounds, may become one who correctly preaches the Tathagata-truth, a preacher of Dharma,
and one who declares also the logical sequence of dharma. The Lord: So it is, Kausika.When
you teach and expound as he does, then you become one who correctly preaches the Tathagata-truth,
a preacher of dharma, and one who declares also the dharma’s logical sequence.For
whatever (455) the Elder Subhuti makes clear, that he makes clear with reference to
emptiness.Because the Elder Subhuti does not, to begin with, even review or apprehend the
perfection of wisdom, how much less him who courses in the perfection of wisdom.Even enlightenment,
to begin with, he does not get at, how much less at him who will know full enlightenment.Even
all-knowledge he does not get at, how much less at him who will reach all-knowledge.Even
Suchness he does not get at, how much less at him who will become a Tathagata.Even
non-production he does not get at,how much less at him who will fully awake to enlightenment.Even
the powers he does not get at, how much less at him who will possess the powers.Even
the grounds of self-confidence he does not review, how much less him who will be
self-confident.Even the dharma he does not get at, how much less at him who will demonstrate
dharma.For Subhuti the Elder dwells in the dwelling of the isolatedness of all dharmas,
in the dwelling of the baselessness of all dharmas.And it is quite certain that this dwelling
in the isolatedness and baselessness of all dharmas, on the part of Subhuti the Elder,
is of infinitesimal value compared with the dwelling of a Bodhisattva who courses in perfect
wisdom, and who dwells in it.Because, except for the dwelling of a Tathagata this dwelling
of a Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom, who dwells in it, surpasses all other
dwellings.(456) This dwelling has been described as the foremost of all dwellings, as the
best, the choicest, the most excellent, the most sublime, the highest, the supreme, the
unequalled, the incomparable.It surpasses the dwellings of all Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas.Therefore
then, Kausika, a son or daughter of a good family who wants to arrive at what
is the highest possible degree of perfection for all beings, to arrive at the best state,
the choicest state, the most excellent state, the most sublime state, the incomparable state,
- they should dwell in this dwelling of the Bodhisattvas who course in perfect wisdom,
who dwell in it.
