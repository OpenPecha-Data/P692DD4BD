3. Perfect wisdom, a great spellThe Lord: So it is, Kausika.The merit of the devotee of the
perfection of wisdom is greater than that;it is immeasurable,incalculable, (71,1)inconceivable,incomparable,illimitable.Because
from the perfection of wisdom the all-knowledge of the
Tathagatas has come forth;from all-knowledge has come forth the cult of the relics of the
Tathagata.Therefore the accumulation of merit of the devotee of the perfection of wisdom
bears no proportion at all to the accumulation of merit born from building Stupas, made
of the seven precious things, enshrining the relics of the Tathagata.

(72) Thereupon those forty thousand gods in the assembly said to Sakra, the Chief of Gods: Sir!
do take up the perfection of wisdom!The perfection of wisdom, Sir, should be taken up,
recited, studied and explained!The Lord: Kausika, do take up the perfection of wisdom,recite,
study and explain it!For if the Asuras form the idea of having a fight with the Gods
of the Thirty-three, and if you, Kausika, bring to mind and repeat this perfection of wisdom,
then the Asuras will drop that idea again.

(73) Sakra: A great lore is this perfection of wisdom,a lore without measure,a quite measureless
lore,an unsurpassed lore,an unequalled lore,a lore which equals the unequalled.The Lord:
So it is, Kausika.For thanks to this lore, i.e. the perfection of wisdom, the Buddhas
of the past have known full enlightenment.Thanks to it the Buddhas of the future will know
it.Thanks to it, the Buddhas of the present do know it.Thanks to it I have known it.(74)
Thanks to just this lore do the ten wholesome ways of acting become manifest in the world,
the four trances associated with the limbs of enlightenment, the four Unlimited associated
with the limbs of enlightenment, the four formless attainments upheld by the limbs of enlightenment,
the six super-knowledges associated with the limbs of enlightenment, in short
the eighty-four thousand articles of dharma, the cognition of the Buddha, the cognition of
the Self-existent, the inconceivable cognition.But when there are no Tathagatas in the world,
then it is the Bodhisattvas, - endowed with skill in means as a result of hearing the
outpouring of the perfection of wisdom in the past (when there were Buddhas), full of pity
for beings, come into this world out of pity, - who foster in the world the ten wholesome
ways of acting, the four trances as dissociated from the limbs of enlightenment, etc. to:
the fiver super-knowledges as dissociated from the limbs of enlightenment.(75) Just as
thanks to the disk of the moon all the herbs, stars and constellations are illuminated according
to their power and strength, so, after the Tathagata has passed away and His good dharma
has disappeared, in the absence of the Tathagatas, whatever righteous, upright, outstanding,
or wholesome life is conceived and manifested in the world, all that has come forth
from the Bodhisattva, has been brought forth by him, has spread from his skill in means.But
the skill in means of the Bodhisattvas should be known as having come forth from the
perfection of wisdom.

Moreover, those who are devoted to the perfection of wisdom, should expect therefrom many advantages
here and now.Sakra: Which are those advantages? The Lord: Those devotees will not
die an untimely death, nor from poison, or sword, or fire, or water, or staff, or violence.When
they bring to mind and repeat this perfection of wisdom, (76) the calamities which
threaten them from kings and princes, from king’s counsellors and king’s ministers, will not
take place.If kings, etc., would try to do harm to those who again and again bring to mind
and repeat the perfection of wisdom they will not succeed; because the perfection of wisdom
upholds them.Although kings, etc., may approach them with harmful intent, they will
instead decide to greet them, to converse with them, to be polite and friendly to them.For
this perfection of wisdom entails an attitude of friendliness and compassion towards all
beings.Therefore, even though the devotee of the perfection of wisdom may be in the middle
of a wilderness infested with venomous vipers, neither men nor ghosts can harm them, except
as a punishment for past deeds.

Thereupon one hundred Wanderers of other sects approached the Lord with hostile intent.Sakra,
Chief of Gods, perceived those Wanderers from afar, and he reflected: Surely, those Wanderers
of other sects are approaching the Lord with hostile intent.Let me then recall as much
of this perfection of wisdom as I have learned from the Lord, (77) bring it to mind, repeat
and spread it, so that those Wanderers cannot approach the Lord,and the preaching of
this perfection of wisdom may not be interrupted.Thereupon Sakra, Chief of Gods, recalled
as much of this perfection of wisdom as he had learned from the Lord, brought it to mind,
repeated and spread it.Those Wanderers of other sects thereupon reverently saluted the Lord
from afar, and went off on their way.Thereupon it occurred to the Venerable Sariputra: For
what reason have those heretical Wanderers reverently saluted the Lord from afar, and then
departed on their way? The Lord: When Sakra, Chief of Gods, perceived the thoughts of
those hostile Wanderers of other sects, he recalled this perfection of wisdom, brought it
to mind, repeated it and spread it, with the object of turning back those Wanderers of other
sects who wanted to quarrel, dispute and obstruct, and of preventing them from approaching
the place where the perfection of wisdom is being taught.And I have granted permission
to Indra, Chief of Gods.Because I saw not even one pure dharma in those Wanderers.(78) They
all wanted to approach with hostile intent, with thoughts of enmity.

Thereupon it occurred to Mara, the Evil One: The four assemblies of the Tathagata are assembled,
and seated face to face with the Tathagata.Face to face [with the Tathagata] those Gods
of the realm of sense-desire and of the realm of formare sure to be predicted in that assembly
as Bodhisattvas to full enlightenment.Let me now approach to blind them.– Thereupon
Mara conjured up a fourfold army, and moved towards the place where the Lord was.Thereupon
it occurred to Sakra, chief of gods: Surely, this is Mara, the Evil One, who, having conjured
up a fourfold army, moves towards the place where the Lord is.But the array of this
army is not the array of King Bimbisara’s army, not of King Prasenajit’s army, not of the
army of the Sakyas or of the Licchavins.For a long time Mara the Evil One has pursued the
Lord, looking for a chance to enter, searching for a chance to enter, intent on hurting beings.I
will now recall this perfection of wisdom, bring it to mind, repeat and spread it.Thereupon
Sakra recalled just this perfection of wisdom, brought it to mind, repeated and
spread it.(79) Immediately Mara, the Evil One, turned back again, and went on his way.

Thereupon the Gods of the Thirty-three conjured up heavenly Mandarava flowers, flew through
the air, and scattered them over the Lord. And in triumph they cried: “For a long time surely
has this perfection of wisdom come to the men of Jambudvipa!”Seizing more Mandarava flowers,
they scattered and strewed them over the Lord,and said: “Mara and his host will have
no chance to enter those beings who preach and develop the perfection of wisdom, or who
course in it.Those beings who hear and study the perfection of wisdom will be endowed with
no small wholesome root.Those who come to hear of this perfection of wisdom have fulfilled
their duties under the Jinas of the past.How much more so those who will study and repeat
it, who will be trained in Thusness, progress to it, make endeavours about it; they will
be people who have honoured the Tathagatas.(80) For it is in this perfection of wisdom that
one should search for all-knowledge.Just as all jewels are brought forth by the great ocean,
and should be searched for through it, just so the great jewel of the all-knowledge
of the Tathagatas should be searched for through the great ocean of the perfection of wisdom.”The
Lord: So it is, Kausika.It is from the great ocean of the perfection of wisdom that
the great jewel of the all-knowledge of the Tathagatas has come forth.
