5. Requisites of going forth to enlightenmentSubhuti: How should a Bodhisattva behave, how should
he train, if he wants to go forth to the full and supreme enlightenment? The Lord: The
Bodhisattva should adopt the same attitude towards all beings,his mind should be even towards
all beings,he should not handle others with an uneven mind,but with a mind which is
friendly,well disposed,helpful,free from aversion,avoiding harmand hurt,he should handle
others as if they were his mother, father, son or daughter.(322) As a saviour of all beings
should a Bodhisattva behave towards all beings, should he train himself, if he wants to
know the full and supreme enlightenment.He should, himself, stand in the abstention from all
evil,he should give gifts, guard his morality, perfect himself in patience, exert vigour,
enter into the trances, achieve mastery over wisdom, survey conditioned coproduction, both
in direct and in reverse order; and also others he should instigate to do the same, incite
and encourage them.In the same way he should stand in everything from the meditation
on the truths to the stage when he reaches the certainty that it is as a Bodhisattva that
he will be saved, and when he matures beings, and also others he should instigate to do the
same, incite and encourage them.When he longs eagerly for all that and trains himself in
it, then everything will be uncovered to him, from form to the established order of dharma.
