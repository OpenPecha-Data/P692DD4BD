2. The range of jubilationSubhuti: A Bodhisattva, a great being, considers the world with its
ten directions, in every direction, extending everywhere. He considers the world systems,
quite immeasurable, quite beyond reckoning, quite measureless, quite inconceivable, infinite
and boundless. He considers in the past period, in each single direction, in each single
world system, the Tathagatas, quite immeasurable, quite beyond reckoning, quite measureless,
quite inconceivable, infinite and boundless, who have won final Nirvana in the realm
of Nirvana which leaves nothing behind, - (136) their tracks cut off, their course cut off,
their obstacles annulled, guides through [the world of] becoming, their tears dried up,
with all their impediments crushed, their own burdens laid down, with their own weal reached,
in whom the fetters of becoming are extinguished, whose thoughts are well freed by right
understanding, and who have attained to the highest perfection in the control of their
entire hearts.He considers them, from where they began with the production of the thought
of enlightenment, proceeding to the time when they won full enlightenment, until they finally
entered Nirvana in the realm of Nirvana which leaves nothing behind, and the whole span
of time up to the vanishing of the good Dharma [as preached by each one of these Tathagatas].
He considers the mass of morality, the mass of concentration, the mass of wisdom,
the mass of emancipation, the mass of the vision and cognition of emancipation of those Buddhas
and Lords.In addition he considers the store of merit associated with the six perfections,
with the achievement of the qualities of a Buddha, and with the perfections of self-confidence
and of the powers; and also those associated with the perfection of the superknowledges,
of comprehension, of the vows; and the store of merit associated with the accomplishment
of the cognition of the all-knowing, with the solicitude for beings, the great friendliness
and the great compassion, and the immeasurable and incalculable Buddha-qualities.And
he also considers the full enlightenment and its happiness, and the perfection of the
sovereignty over all dharmas, and the accomplishment of the measureless and unconquered
supreme wonderworking power which has conquered all, and the power of the Tathagata’s cognition
of what is truly real, which is without covering, attachment or obstruction, unequalled,
equal to the unequalled, incomparable, without measure, and the power of the Buddha-cognition
preeminent among the powers, and the vision and cognition of a Buddha, the perfection
of the ten powers, the obtainment of that supreme ease which results from the four grounds
of self-confidence, (137) and the obtainment of Dharma through the realization of the
ultimate reality of all dharmas.He also considers the turning of the wheel of Dharma, the
carrying of the torch of Dharma, the beating of the drum of Dharma, the filling up of the
conch shell of Dharma, the wielding of the sword of Dharma, the pouring down of the rain
of Dharma, and the refreshment of all beings through the gift of Dharma, through its presentation
to them.He further considers the store of merit of all those who are educated and
trained by those demonstrations of Dharma, - whether they concern the dharmas of Buddhas,
or those of Pratyekabuddhas, or of Disciples, - who believe in them, who are fixed on them,
who are bound to end up in full enlightenment.He also considers the store of merit, associated
with the six perfections, of all those Bodhisattvas of whom those Buddhas and Lords
have predicted full enlightenment. He considers the store of merit of all those persons
who belong to the Pratyekabuddha vehicle, and of whom the enlightenment of a Pratyekabuddha
has been predicted. He considers the meritorious work founded on giving, morality and meditational
development, of the four assemblies of those Buddhas and Lords, i.e. of the monks
and nuns, the laymen and laywomen. He considers the roots of good planted during all that
time by Gods, Nagas, Yakshas, Gandharvas, Asuras, Garudas, Kinnaras and Mahoragas, by
men and ghosts, and also by animals, at the time when those Buddhas and Lords demonstrated
the Dharma, and when they entered Pairinirvana, and when they had entered Parinirvana (138)
– thanks to the Buddha, the Lord, thanks to the Dharma, thanks to the Samgha, and thanks
to persons of right mind-culture.[In his meditation the Bodhisattva] piles up the roots
of good of all those, all that quantity of merit without exception or remainder, rolls it
into one lump, weighs it, and rejoices over it with the most excellent and sublime jubilation,
the highest and utmost jubilation, with none above it, unequalled, equalling the unequalled.Having
thus rejoiced, he utters the remark: “I turn over into full enlightenment the
meritorious work founded on jubilation. May it feed the full enlightenment [of myself and
of all beings]!”
