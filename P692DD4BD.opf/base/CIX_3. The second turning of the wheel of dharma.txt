3. The second turning of the wheel of dharmaThereupon a great many thousands of Gods in the
intermediate realm called out aloud with cries of joy, waved their garments, and said: We
now, indeed, see the second turning of the wheel of dharma taking place in Jambudvipa!The
Lord: This, Subhuti, is not the second turning of the wheel of dharma. No dharma can be turned
forwards or backwards.Just this is a Bodhisattvaâ€™s perfection of wisdom.

(204) Subhuti: Great is this perfection of a Bodhisattva who, unattached to all dharmas, wants
to know full enlightenment, and who yet is not enlightened about any dharma, or who will
turn the wheel of dharma and who yet will not show up any dharma.For no dharma is here got
at, no dharma is indicated,no dharma will move on any dharma.Because absolutely, reproduction
is alien to all dharmas.Nor will any dharma turn back any other dharma.Because from
the very beginning all dharmas have not been reproduced, since their essential nature is
isolated.

The Lord: So it is, Subhuti.For emptiness does not proceed nor recede,and that holds good also
for the Signlessand the Wishless.To demonstrate that is to demonstrate all dharmas.But
no one has demonstrated it, no one has heard it, no one has received it, and no one realizes
it, in the past, present or future.Nor by this demonstration of dharma does anyone every
go to Nirvana.Nor by this demonstration of dharma has anyone ever been made worthy of gifts.
