5. Further advantages from perfect wisdomSakra: So far the Tathagata has not proclaimed all
the qualities of the perfection of wisdom, qualities which one acquires by learning, studying
and repeating the perfection of wisdom.For how else could the limited amount of the perfection
of wisdom, which I had learned from the Lord, have spread [when just now the heretics
and Mara were turned away]! TheLord: So it is, Kausika.Moreover, not only one who has
learned, studied and repeated the perfection of wisdom, will have those qualities,but also
one who worships a copy of it,he also, I teach, will have those advantages here and now.

(83) Sakra: I also will protect one who worships a copy of the perfection of wisdom, and still
more so one who in addition learns, studies and repeats it.

The Lord: Well said, Kausika.Moreover, when someone repeats this perfection of wisdom, many
hundreds of Gods will come near,many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of Gods, so as
to listen to the dharma.And, when they hear the dharma, those Gods will want to induce a readiness
to speak in that preacher of dharma.Even when he is not willing to talk, the Gods
still expect that, through their respect for dharma, a readiness to speak will be induced
in him, and that he will feel urged to teach.(84) This again is another quality which someone
acquires just here and now when learning, studying, and repeating the perfection of wisdom.

Moreover, the minds of those who teach this perfection of wisdom will remain uncowed in front
of the four assemblies. They will have no fear of being plied with questions by hostile
persons.For the perfection of wisdom protects them.Immersed in the perfection of wisdom one
does not see the hostility, nor those who act with hostility, nor those who want to be hostile.In
that way, upheld by the perfection of wisdom, one remains unaffected by censure
and fear.These qualities also someone acquires just here and now when learning, studying and
repeating the perfection of wisdom.

In addition, he will be dear to his mother and father, to friends, relatives and kinsmen, to
Sramanas and Brahmanas. Competent he will be and capable of refuting, in accordance with
dharma, any counter-arguments that may arise, and able to deal with counter-questions.These
qualities also someone acquires just here and now when learning, studying and repeating
the perfection of wisdom.

(85) Moreover, Kausika, among the Gods of the Four Great Kings those Gods who have set out for
full enlightenment will make up their minds to come to the place where someone has put
up a copy of the perfection of wisdom, and worships it.They will come, look upon the copy
of this perfection of wisdom, salute it respectfully, pay homage to it, learn, study and repeat
it.Then they will depart again.And that applies to all the Gods, up to the Highest of
Gods.(88) And that son or daughter of a good family should wish that the Gods, Nagas, Yakshas,
Gandharvas, Asuras, Garudas, Kinnaras, Mahoragas, men and ghosts, in the ten directions
in countless world systems, should, with the help of this book, see the perfection of
wisdom, salute it respectfully, pay homage to it, learn, study and repeat it;that then they
should return to their respective worlds; and that he should be able to give them just
this gift of dharma.You should not however think, Kausika, that only in this four-continent
world the Gods of the realm of sense-desire and of the realm of form, who have set out for
full enlightenment, will decide to come to that place.Not so, Kausika, should you view
it!No, all the Gods in the great trichiliocosm, who have set out for full enlightenment, will
decide to come to that place.They will come, look upon the copy of this perfection of
wisdom, salute it respectfully, pay homage to it, learn, study and repeat it.Moreover, the
house, room or palace of the devotee of the perfection of wisdom will be well guarded.No
one will harm him, except as a punishment for past deeds.This is another quality which one
acquires just here and now. (89) For very powerful Gods, and other supernatural beings, will
decide to come to that place.

Sakra: How does one know that Gods, or other supernatural beings, have come to that place to
hear, etc., the perfection of wisdom? The Lord: When one perceives somewhere a sublime radiance
or smells a superhuman odour not smelled before, then one should know for certain that
a God, or other supernatural being, has come, has come near.

Further, clean and pure habits will attract those Gods, etc.,and will make them enraptured,
overjoyed, full of zest and gladness.But the divinities of minor power, who had before occupied
that place, they will decide to leave it.For they cannot endure the splendour, majesty
and dignity of those very powerful Gods, etc.And as those very powerful Gods, etc., will
decide to come to him repeatedly, that devotee of the perfection of wisdom will gain an
abundance of serene faith.This is another quality which that son or daughter of a good family
will acquire just here and now.Further on, one should not form any unclean or impure habits
within the circumference of that abode of the guide to Dharma; otherwise one’s deep
respect for it would remain incomplete.

Moreover, the devotee of the perfection of wisdom will not be fatigued in either body or mind.At
ease he lies down, at ease he walks about. In his sleep he will see no evil dreams. When
he sees anything in his dreams, (91) he will just see the Tathagatas, or Stupas, or Bodhisattvas,
or Disciples of the Tathagata.When he hears sounds, he will hear the sound of
the perfections and of the wings to enlightenment. He will just see the trees of enlightenment;
and underneath them the Tathagatas, while they wake up to full enlightenment.And likewise
he will see how the fully Enlightened turn the wheel of dharma. And many Bodhisattvas
he will see, chanting just this perfection of wisdom, delighted by its chorus, which proclaims
how all-knowledge should be gained, how the Buddha-field should be purified. He is
shown the skill in means.He hears the sublime sound of the full enlightenment of the Buddhas,
the Lords: ‘In this direction, in this part of the world, in this world system, under
this name, a Tathagata demonstrates the dharma, surrounded and accompanied by many thousands
of Bodhisattvas and Disciples, nay by many hundreds of thousands of niyutas of kotis of
Bodhisattvas and Disciples.’When he has such dreams, he will sleep at ease, he will wake
up at ease. Even when food is thrown into it, his body will still feel at ease, and exceedingly
light.No trend of thought will arise in him from excessive eagerness for food.He will
take only a mild interest in food.(92) A devotee of the perfection of wisdom has no strong
desire for food, and only a mild interest in it, even as a monk, who practices Yoga, and
who has emerged from trance, - because his thoughts overflow with other interests.For to
the extent that he has given himself up to devotion to the development of the perfection
of wisdom, to that extent heavenly beings will provide him with heavenly food.These qualities
also does one acquire even here and now.

But again, Kausika, if someone has made a copy of the perfection of wisdom, and worships it,
but does not learn, study and repeat it;and if someone else truly believes in the perfection
of wisdom, trustingly confides in it, and, resolutely intent on it, serene in his faith,
his thoughts raised to enlightenment, in earnest intent, hears it, learns it, bears it
in mind, recites and studies it, spreads, demonstrates, explains, expounds and repeats it,
illuminates it in detail for others, uncovers its meaning, investigates it with his mind,
and, using his wisdom to the fullest, thoroughly examines it; copies it, and preserves and
stores away the copy, so that the good dharma might last long, so that the guide of the
Tathagatas might not be annihilated, so that the good dharma might not disappear,so that the
Bodhisattvas, the great beings, might continue to be assisted, since their guide will not
fail,- and finally, honours and worships this perfection of wisdom; then the latter begets
the greater merit.(93) He should be imitated by those who want to acquire these distinguished
qualities here and now, and they should truly believe in the perfection of wisdom,
etc., to: because their guide will not fail.He will resolve to share it with those who desire
it. So the great eye of the Guide of the Buddhas will not fail, either for him, or for
others who are in quest of virtue.In addition the perfection of wisdom should at all times
be honoured and worshipped.
