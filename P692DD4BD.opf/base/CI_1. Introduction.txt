1. IntroductionThus have I heard at one time. The Lord dwelt at Rajagriha, on the Vulture Peak,
together with a great gathering of monks, with 1,250 monks, all of them Arhats, - their
outflows dried up, undefiled, fully controlled, quite freed in their hearts, well freed
and wise, thoroughbreds, great Serpents, their work done, their task accomplished, their burdens
laid down, their own weal accomplished, with the fetters that bound them to becoming
extinguished, their hearts well freed by right understanding, in perfect control of their
whole minds – with the exception of one single person, i.e., the Venerable Ananda.

The Lord said to the Venerable Subhuti, the Elder: Make it clear now, Subhuti, to the Bodhisattvas,
the great beings, starting from perfect wisdom, how the Bodhisattvas, the great beings
go forth into perfect wisdom!

Thereupon the Venerable Sariputra thought to himself: (4) Will that Venerable Subhuti, the Elder,
expound perfect wisdom of himself, through the operation and force of his own power
of revealing wisdom, or through the Buddha’s might?

The Venerable Subhuti, who knew, through the Buddha’s might, that the Venerable Sariputra was
in such wise discoursing in his heart, said to the Venerable Sariputra: Whatever, Venerable
Sariputra, the Lord’s Disciples teach, all that is to be known as the Tathagata’s work.For
in the dharma demonstrated by the Tathagata they train themselves, they realise its true
nature, they hold it in mind. Thereafter nothing that they teach contradicts the true
nature of dharma. It is just an outpouring of the Tathagata's demonstration of dharma.Whatever
those sons of good family may expound as the nature of dharma, that they do not bring
into contradiction with the actual nature of dharma.
