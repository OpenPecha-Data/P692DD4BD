6. Advantages derived from perfect wisdomWhen a Bodhisattva courses in perfect wisdom, Mara
the Evil One feels struck with the dark of great sorrow,just as a man does when his mother
or father have died.

Subhuti: Is this affliction confined to one Mara, or does it affect many Maras, or does it extend
to all the Maras in the great trichiliocosm? The Lord: At the time when Bodhisattvas
dwell in the dwelling of perfect wisdom at that time all the Maras in the great trichiliocosm
feel struck with the dart of great sorrow, and they cannot sit still on their respective
thrones.(472) For the entire world, with its Gods, men and Asuras, cannot gain entry to
a Bodhisattva who dwells within the dwelling of perfect wisdom, it cannot gain a foothold
which would allow it to take possession of him, to hurt him, to turn him away from full
enlightenment.Therefore then, Subhuti, a Bodhisattva who wants to know full enlightenment
should course in perfect wisdom.For in a Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom the perfection
of giving arrives at its most perfect development, and so do the perfections of morality,
patience, vigour, and concentration.In him all the six perfections arrive at their
most perfect development, and also all the varieties of skill in means.Whatever deeds of
Mara may arise in a Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom, he shall wisely know them when
they are taking place, and he shall get rid of them again.A Bodhisattva who wants to acquire
all the varieties of skill in means should course in perfect wisdom, and develop it.At
the time when a Bodhisattva courses in perfect wisdom, and aspires for it, he should bring
to mind not only the Buddhas and Lords who reside in countless world systems,but also
their all-knowledge which has come forth from this perfection of wisdom.He should then produce
the thought that “also I shall reach those dharmas which those Buddhas and Lords have
reached!” (473,1)For a day, or even down to the time taken up by a finger snap, should a
Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom raise such thoughts and aspire to them.But a Bodhisattva
who would even for one day, or even for the duration of a fingersnap, aspire for
this perfection of wisdom would beget more merit than a Bodhisattva who leans on a basis,
and who for countless aeons gives gifts.Such a Bodhisattva will stand in irreversibility.A
Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom and who, even for a day, or even for the duration
of a finger snap, raises such thoughts, has, we know, been brought to mind by the Tathagatas.How
much more so one who daily pursues such thoughts.What future destiny should one
expect a Bodhisattva to have whom the Tathagatas have brought to mind? No other destiny except
full enlightenment can be expected of him.He cannot possibly be reborn in the states
of woe.One must expect that he will be reborn in heaven,and that even there he will not be
without the Tathagatas, and that he will mature beings.These are the qualities and advantages
of a Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom, who aspires for perfect wisdom, and
who raises such thoughts, (474) if even for the length of a finger snap.How much greater will
be the advantage of one who pursues such thoughts daily, as for instance the Bodhisattva
Gandhahastin who just now leads the holy life in the presence of the Tathagata Akshobhya.

Chapter XXIX Approaches

Furthermore, Subhuti, a Bodhisattva should approach the perfection of wisdom as follows: Through
non-attachment to all dharmas.From the non-differentiatedness of all dharmas.From the
fact that all dharmas cannot possibly come about.In the conviction that “all dharmas are
equal in remaining unaffected by change.”Because he has recognized by wisdom that all dharmas,
as without self, give us no hint [about their true nature or intentions].In the conviction
that “all talk about dharmas [is extraneous to them], consists in mere words, mere conventional
expression,”– but the conventional expression does not refer to anything real,
it is not derived from anything real, nor is itself anything real.In the conviction that
“all dharmas lie outside conventional expression and discourse, that it is not they that have
been conventionally expressed or uttered.”From the unlimitedness of all dharmas.From the
unlimitedness of form, etc.,from the signlessness of all dharmas.(476) By penetration into
all dharmas.From the fact that all dharmas are perfectly pure in their original nature.From
the fact that all dharmas are beyond words.Because all the different kinds of forsaking
are really equal [in value and kind], since all dharmas have never been stopped.Because
Suchness is everywhere the same, since all dharmas have already attained Nirvana.In the
conviction that “all dharmas do not come, nor do they go; they cannot be generated, they are
unborn, their non-birth being absolute.”Because he observes neither himself nor others.In
the conviction that “all dharmas are holy Arhats, perfectly pure in their original nature.”In
the conviction that “all dharmas have put down their burden, because no burden had
ever been put on them.”From the fact that all dharmas have neither place nor locality.For
form, etc., is without place and locality, in accordance with the own-being of its original
nature.Because he is exhilarated by the cessation of all dharmas.Because he feels neither
content nor discontent.Because he becomes neither impassioned nor dispassionate.For form,
etc., in their true reality, in their own-being, do not become either impassioned or dispassioned.In
the conviction that “the original nature [of all dharmas], is perfectly pure.”In
the conviction that, “all dharmas are non-attached, free from both attachment and non-attachment.”
(477,1)In the conviction that “all dharmas are essentially enlightenment, because
they are all equally understood by the Buddha-cognition.”From the emptiness, Signlessness
and Wishlessness of all dharmas.In the conviction that “all dharmas are essentially a
healing medicine, because they are controlled by friendliness.”In the conviction that “all
dharmas are dwellers in friendliness, dwellers in compassion, dwellers in sympathetic joy,
dwellers in impartiality.”In the conviction that “all dharmas are identified with the supreme
universal spirit, because in their being no faults can arise, because in their essential
being all faults remain unproduced.”In the conviction that “all dharmas are equally
neither hopeful nor hostile.”One should approach the boundlessness of the perfection of wisdom
through [the analogy of] the boundlessness of the ocean;through [the analogy of] the
multicoloured brilliance of Meru.One should approach the boundlessness of the perfection of
wisdom: from the boundlessness of form, etc.;through the [analogy of] boundless illumination
shed by the circle of the sun’s rays;from the boundlessness of all sounds;from the boundlessness
of the final achievement of all the dharmas of a Buddha;from the boundlessness
[of the excellence] of the equipment of the whole world of beings with merit and cognition;from
the boundlessness of the element of earth;and so from the boundlessness of the elements
of water, fire, air, space and consciousness.(478) One should approach the unlimitedness
of the perfection of wisdom from the unlimitedness of the collection of wholesome and
unwholesome dharmas;from the unlimitedness of the collection of all dharmas.One should approach
the boundlessness of the perfection of wisdom: through the acquisition of the boundlessness
of the concentration on all dharmas;from the boundlessness of all Buddha-dharmas;from
the boundlessness of all dharmas;from the boundlessness of emptiness;from the boundlessness
of thought and its constituents;from the boundlessness of thoughts and actions.One should
approach the measurelessness of the perfection of wisdom from the measurelessness of
wholesome and unwholesome dharmas.One should approach the resounding declarations of the
perfection of wisdom through the [analogy of the] roaring of the lion’s roar.One should approach
the fact that the perfection of wisdom cannot be shaken by outside factors from the
fact that all dharmas cannot be shaken by outside factors.For form, etc., is like the ocean.Form,
and each skandha, is like the firmament;like the brilliant and multicoloured Meru;like
the production of the rays of the disk of the sun;boundless like all sounds;boundless
like the whole world of beings;boundless like the final achievement of the dharmas of a
Buddha;boundless like the equipment with merit and cognition of all beings in the world;(479)
it is like the earth,like water,fire,air,spaceand consciousness;it has no definite boundary
like the collection of all wholesome and unwholesome dharmas;it has no definite boundary
like the collection of all dharmas.Form is the departure [into Buddhahood], the own-being
of form is the Buddha-dharmas which are essentially the Suchness of form; etc., to: consciousness
is departure [into Buddhahood], the own-being of consciousness is the Buddha-dharmas
which are essentially the Suchness of consciousness.Form, and each skandha, is the
boundless true nature of all dharmas;the empty, boundless true nature [of things];the boundlessness
of thought and its constituents;it gives rise to thoughts and actions;it is wholesome
or unwholesome until there is non-apprehension;it is like the lion’s roar;it cannot
be shaken by outside factors.In such ways should a Bodhisattva approach perfect wisdom.

(480) If the Bodhisattva approaches perfect wisdom in this way, apperceives it, enters into
it, understands it, reflects on it, examines, investigates, and develops it, - with acts of
mind that have abandoned all deception and deceit, all conceit, the exaltation of self,
all laziness, the deprecation of others, the notion of self, the notion of a being, gain,
honour and fame, the five hindrances, envy and meanness, and all vacillation, - then it will
not be hard for him to gain the full perfection of all virtues, of the Buddha-field and
of the supreme dharmas of a Buddha.
