6. Obstacles to perfect wisdomSubhuti: Deep, O Lord, is perfect wisdom.It is a heap of treasure.It
is a pure heap, as pure as space.It would not be surprising if many obstacles should
arise to someone who takes up, etc., this perfection of wisdom.(221) The Lord: There will
be many obstacles to the study of this perfection of wisdom.For Mara, the Evil One, will
make great efforts to cause difficulties.Therefore one should hurry up with oneâ€™s task of
copying it out. If one has one month to do it in, or two months, or three months, one should
just carry on with the writing.If one has a year or more, even then one should just carry
on with writing this perfection of wisdom [since after, or even during, that time one
may be prevented by all kinds of interruptions].Because it is a fact that in respect of very
precious things many difficulties are wont to arise.

Subhuti: Here, O Lord, when the perfection of wisdom is being studied, Mara, the Evil One, will
in many ways show zeal, and exert himself to cause difficulties.The Lord: In spite of
that (222) he is powerless to cause really effective obstacles to a Bodhisattva who gives
his undivided attention to his task.
