1. Sakra praises the bodhisattvasThereupon it occurred to Sakra, Chief of Gods: A Bodhisattva,
even if he courses only just so far, surpasses all; how much more so when he has known
full enlightenment!A great gain has accrued to those beings, a good life do they live when
their thought strides in all-knowledge;how much more so when they have raised their thought
to full enlightenment!To be envied are those beings, the very cream of all beings, who
will know full enlightenment!

Thereupon Sakra, Chief of Gods, conjured up Mandarava flowers, saluted them reverently, scattered
them over the Tathagata, and said: May those persons who belong to the vehicle of the
Bodhisattvas, and who have raised their thoughts to full enlightenment, succeed in their
resolve to know full enlightenment, and, after that, to transfer all beings who are borne
along by the great flood of birth-and-death to the smooth yonder shore! May that thought
of enlightenment which they have wished for, thought over and taken hold of, bring to fulfilment
in them the dharmas of a Buddha, the dharmas associated with all-knowledge, the dharmas
of the Self-Existent, the insuperable dharmas!I have not even the slightest suspicion
that those Bodhisattvas, who are endowed with the great compassion, might turn away from
full enlightenment,(435) or that those persons who belong to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas
and who have set out for full enlightenment might turn away from it.On the contrary, I
am sure that this resolve to win full enlightenment will increase more and more in them, as
they survey the ills which afflict beings on the plane of birth-and-death.For through their
great compassion they desire the welfare of the world with its Gods, men and Asuras, desire
to benefit it, are full of pity for it, they, who are endowed with this attitude of
mind, dwell in the attitude of mind which is expressed in their resolution that “we have crossed
over, we shall help beings to cross over! Freed we shall free them! Recovered we shall
help them to recover! Gone to Nirvana we shall lead them to Nirvana!”
