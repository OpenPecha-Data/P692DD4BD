4. How perverted views can be avoidedMaitreya: The Bodhisattva must not, as a result of the
thought by which he turns that over, become one who perceives a thought.It is thus that the
meritorious work founded on jubilation becomes something which is turned over into full
enlightenment.If he does not perceive that thought, [identifying it] as ‘this is that thought,’
then a Bodhisattva has no perverted perception, thought or view.But if he perceives
the thought by which he turns that over, [identifying it] as ‘this is that thought,’ then
he becomes one who perceives thought.As a result he has a perverted perception, thought and
view.But a Bodhisattva turns over rightly, not wrongly, when he perceives and brings to
mind the thought which turns over (143,1)in such a way that he regards it as ‘just extinct,
extinct,’ as ‘stopped, departed, reversed’;and when he reflects that what is extinct that
canot be turned over;and that this [extinctness, etc.] is the very dharmic nature also of
that thought by which one turns over,and also of the dharmas through which one turns over,as
well as of the dharmas to which one turns over.It is thus that the Bodhisattva should
turn over.

He should [in 145-49] consider the future Buddhas, the present Buddhas, the past, future and
present Buddhas in the same way in which he considered the past Buddhas.

Under which circumstances is he without perverted perception, thought or views? If, while he
turns over, he brings to mind those dharmas as extinct, stopped, departed, reversed, and
that dharma into which it is turned over as inextinguishable, then it [the wholesome root]
becomes something which has been turned over into full enlightenment. For he does not settle
down in that process of dedication.If further he considers that no dharma can be turned
over into a dharma, then also it becomes something which has been turned over into full
enlightenment.It is thus that the Bodhisattva who turns over is without perverted perception,
thought or view.For he does not settle down in that process of dedication.If further he
perceives that thought cannot cognize thought, nor can dharma cognize dharma, then also
it becomes something which has been turned over into full enlightenment.This is the supreme
maturity of the Bodhisattva.But if, on the other hand, a Bodhisattva perceives that accumulation
of merit, then he cannot turn it over into full enlightenment.Because he settles
down in that process of dedication.If further he reflects that also this accumulation of merit
is isolated and quietly calm, that also the meritorious work founded on jubilation (150)
is isolated and quietly calm, then he turns over into full enlightenment.If in addition
he does not even perceive that all conditioned events are calmly quiet and isolated, then
that is the perfection of wisdom of that Bodhisattva.But he does not turn over into full
enlightenment if he perceives that this here is the wholesome root of the Buddhas, the Lords
who have gone to Parinirvana; that that wholesome root is just as [illusory] as that process
of dedication; and that also that [thought] by which it is turned over is of the same
kind, has the same mark, belongs to the same class, has the same own-being.For the Buddhas
and Lords do not allow a dedication to take place through a sign.He does not bring to
mind nor turn over [that wholesome root] to full enlightenment if he brings about a sign by
reflecting that what is past is extinct, stopped, departed, reversed; that what is future
has not yet arrived; and that of the present no stability is got at, and that that which
is not got at has no sign or range.On the other hand he also does not turn over to full enlightenment
if he fails to bring about a sign or to bring to mind as a result of sheer inattentiveness,
if he fails to attend as a result of lack of mindfulness, or of lack of understanding.But
that wholesome root becomes something which has been turned over into full
enlightenment on condition that he brings to mind that sign, but does not treat it as a sign.It
is thus that the Bodhisattva should train himself therein. This should be known as his
skill in means.When, through that skill in means, he turns over a wholesome root, then
he is near to all-knowledge.The Bodhisattva who wants to train himself in this skill in means
should, however, constantly hear just this perfection of wisdom, study it and ask questions
about it.(151) For without the help of the perfection of wisdom one untaught cannot
enter on the work of dedication by means of the perfection of wisdom.But one should not make
a statement to the effect that thanks to the perfection of wisdom it is possible to transform
that meritorious work into full enlightenment.For stopped are those personal lives,
stopped are those karma-formations, calmly quiet, isolated, lacking in basis.Moreover, that
person has brought about a sign, and made a discrimination, he perceives what is truly
real in what is not truly real as if it were truly real, and he would transform a basis into
what is without basis. The Buddhas, the Lords do not allow his wholesome roots to become
something which is in this way transformed into full enlightenment.For they become to him
a great basis. Even the Parinirvana of Buddhas, the Lords he treats as a sign and discriminates,he
gets at Nirvana from a viewpoint,and it is not the dedication carried out by one
who perceives a basis which the Tathagatas have called a source of great welfare.For this
process of dedication is not without poison, not without torn.It is just as with food that
seems excellent, but is really poisonous. Its colour, smell, taste and touch seem desirable,
but nevertheless, as poisonous it should be shunned and not eaten by circumspect people.Although
fools and stupid people might think that it should be eaten.The colour, smell,
taste and touch of that food promise happiness, but its transformation in a man who would
eat it would lead to a painful conclusion.As a result he would incur death, or deadly pain.Just
so some [perceivers of a basis] who seize badly the meaning of what is well taught,
badly distinguish it, badly master it, and misunderstand it, not understanding the meaning
as it really is, they will instruct (152) and admonish others to consider the mass of merit
of the past, future and present Buddhas and Lords, in the way described before [pp. 135-38],
to rejoice at it, and to turn over into full enlightenment the meritorious work founded
on jubilation.Thus that turning over, since it is being carried out by means of a sign,
is turned into poisonousness. It is just like the poisonous food mentioned before.There
can be no turning over for someone who perceives a basis.For a basis is poisonous [has a
range].(153) Therefore a person who belongs to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas should not
train himself thus.How then should he train himself? How should he take hold of the wholesome
root of the past, future and present Buddhas and Lords? And how does that which is taken
hold of become something which is successfully taken hold of? How should he turn over?
And how does it become something which has been successfully turned over into the supreme
enlightenment? Here the son or daughter of a good family who belongs to the vehicle of the
Bodhisattvas, and who does not want to calumniate the Tathagata, should thus rejoice over
all that wholesome root, should thus turn it over: “I rejoice in that wholesome root considered
as the Tathagatas with their Buddha-cognition and their Buddha-eye know and see it,
- its kind such as it is, its class such as it is, its quality such as it is, its own-being
such as it is, its mark such as it is, and it mode of existence such as it is.And I turn
it over in such a way that those Tathagatas can allow that wholesome root to be turned
over into full enlightenment.”When he thus rejoices, thus turns over, a Bodhisattva becomes
free from guilt.The righteousness of the Buddhas, the Lords, is rejoiced in. That wholesome
root becomes something that has been turned over into full enlightenment. And he does
not calumniate those Tathagatas.In this way his turning over becomes a non-poisonous turning
over, a great turning over, a turning over into the dharma-element; it becomes perfect,
quite perfect, through the earnest intention and the resolve of him who turns over.

Moreover, someone who belongs to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas should turn over with the understanding
that all morality, concentration, wisdom, emancipation, vision and cognition
of emancipation, are unincluded in the world of sense-desire, the world of form, the formless
world, and that they are not past, future, or present.For everything that is in the three
periods of time or (154) in the triple world is unincluded [in ultimate reality].In consequence
the turning over is also unincluded,and so is the dharma [i.e. Buddhahood] into
which that process of transformation is being turned,- if only he firmly believes that. When
a Bodhisattva turns over in such a way, he can never again lose the turning over, and it
becomes unincluded, non-poisonous, a great turning over, a turning over of the dharma-element,
perfect, quite perfect.But, on the other hand, when he settles down in what he turns
over, and treats it as a sign, then he turns it over wrongly.A Bodhisattva, however, turns
over with the idea that it is through this turning it over into the dharma-element, as
the Buddhas, the Lords know and permit it, that that wholesome root becomes something which
has been turned over into full enlightenment, successfully turned over. This is the right
method of turning it over.And in this way it becomes something that has been turned over
into supreme enlightenment, successfully turned over.

The Lord: Well said, Subhuti, well said.You perform the office of the Teacher when you demonstrate
Dharma to the Bodhisattvas.For it is this turning over, which is the turning over of
the dharma-element, that is the turning over of a Bodhisattva.He thinks: “As the Buddhas
and Lords know and see that wholesome root in this dharmahood, - its kind such as it is,
its class such as it is, its quality such as it is, its own-being such as it is, its mark
such as it is, its mode of existence such as it is, - so I rejoice in it.And as they grant
permission, so I turn it over.” (155,1)
