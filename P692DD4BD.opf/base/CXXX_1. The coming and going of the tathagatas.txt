1. The coming and going of the TathagatasDharmodgata: Tathagatas certainly do not come from
anywhere, nor do they go anywhere.Because Suchness does not move, and the Tathagata is Suchness.Non-production
does not come nor go, and the Tathagata is non-production.One cannot
conceive of the coming or going of the reality-limit, and the Tathagata is the reality-limit.The
same can be said of emptiness,of what exists in accordance with fact,of dispassion,of
stopping,of the element of space.For the Tathagata is not outside these dharmas.The Suchness
of these dharmas and the Suchness of all dharmas, and the Suchness of the Tathagata
are simply this one single Suchness.There is no division within Suchness.Just simply one single
is this Suchness, not two, nor three.Suchness has passed beyond counting, because it
is not.A man, scorched by the heat of the summer, during the last month of summer (513,1),
at noon might see a mirage floating along,and might run towards it, and think ‘there I shall
find some water, there I shall find something to drink.’What do you think, son of good
family, has that water come from anywhere, or does that water go anywhere, to the Eastern
great ocean, or the Southern, Northern or Western? Sadaprarudita: No water exists in the
mirage.How could its coming or going be conceived? That man again is foolish and stupid if,
on seeing the mirage, he forms the idea of water where there is no water.Water in its own
being certainly does not exist in that mirage.Dharmodgata:Equally foolish are all those
who adhere to the Tathagata through form and sound, and who in consequence imagine the coming
or going of a Tathagata.For a Tathagata cannot be seen from his form-body.The Dharma-bodies
are the Tathagatasand the real nature of dharmas does not come or go.There is no coming
or going of the body of an elephant, horse, chariot or foot-soldier, which has been conjured
up by a magician. Just so there is neither coming nor going of the Tathagatas.A sleeping
man might in his dreams see one Tathagata, or two, or three, or up to one thousand,
or still more (514,1).On waking up he would, however, no longer see even one single Tathagata.What
do you think, son of good family, have these Tathagatas come from anywhere, or gone
to anywhere? Sadaprarudita: One cannot conceive that in that dream any dharma at all had
the status of a full and perfect reality,for the dream was deceptive.Dharmodgata: Just
so the Tathagata has taught that all dharmas are like a dream.All those who do not wisely
know all dharmas as they really are, i.e. as like a dream, as the Tathagata has pointed out,
they adhere to the Tathagatas through their name-body and their form-body, and in consequence
they imagine that the Tathagatas come and go.Those who in their ignorance of the true
nature of dharmas imagine a coming or going of the Tathagatas, they are just foolish common
people,at all times they belong to birth-and-death with its six places of rebirth,and
they are far from the perfection of wisdom,far away from the dharmas of a Buddha.On the contrary,
however, those who know as they really are all dharmas as like a dream, in agreement
with the teaching of the Tathagata, they do not imagine the coming or going of any dharma,
nor its production or stopping.They wisely know the Tathagata in his true nature,and
they do not imagine a coming or going of the Tathagatas.And those who wisely know this true
nature of a Tathagata, they course near to full enlightenmentand they course in the perfection
of wisdom.These disciples of the Lord do not consume their alms fruitlessly, (515,1)and
they are worthy of the world’s gifts.The gems which are in the great ocean do not come
from any place in the East, or West, or in any other of the ten directions, but they owe
their existence to the wholesome roots of beings.They are not produced without cause.And
when, dependent on cause, condition and reason, these gems have been coproduced and stopped
by conditions,they do not pass on to any place anywhere in the world in any of the ten directions.And
nevertheless, then those conditions exist, the gems are augmented; when those
conditions are absent, no augmentation takes place.Just so the perfect body of the Tathagatas
has not come from any place anywhere in the ten directions, and it does not go to any
place anywhere in the world with its ten directions.But the body of the Buddhas and Lords
is not without cause.It has been brought to perfection by their conduct in the past, and
it has been produced dependent on causes and conditions, coproduced by subsidiary conditions,
produced as a result of karma done in the past.It is, however, not in any place anywhere
in the world with its ten directions.But when those conditions exist, the accomplishment
of the body takes place; when those conditions are absent, the accomplishment of the body
becomes inconceivable.When the sound of a boogharp is being produced, it does not come
from anywhere. When it is stopped, it does not go anywhere, nor does it pass on to anywhere.But
it has been produced conditioned by the totality of its causes and conditions, - namely
the boat-shaped hollow body of the harp, the parchment sounding board, the strings, the
hollow arm of the boogharp, the bindings, the plectrum, the person who plays it, and his
exertions. (516) In that way this sound comes forth from the boogharp, dependent on causes,
dependent on conditions.And yet that sound does not come forth from that hollow body of
the harp, nor from the parchment sounding board, nor from the strings, nor from the hollow
arm, nor from the bindings, nor from the plectrum, nor from the person who plays it, nor
from his exertions. It is just the combination of all of them that makes the sound conceivable.And
when it is stopped, the sound also does not go anywhere.Just so the perfect body
of the Buddhas and Lords is dependent on causes, dependent on conditions, and it has been
brought to perfection through exertions which have led to many wholesome roots.But the augmenting
of the Buddha-body does not result from one single cause, nor from one single condition,
nor from one single wholesome root.And it is also not without cause.It has been coproduced
by a totality of many causes and conditions, but it does not come from anywhere.And
when the totality of causes and conditions has ceased to be, then it does not go to anywhere.It
is thus that you should view the coming and going of those Tathagatas,and that you
should conform to the true nature of all dharmas.And it is just because you will wisely
know that the Tathagatas, and also all dharmas, are neither produced nor stopped, that you
shall become fixed on full enlightenment,and that you shall definitely course in the perfection
of wisdom and in skill in means.

When this disquisition on the fact that the Tathagatas neither come nor go had been taught,
the earth and the entire great trichiliocosm shook in six ways, it stirred, quaked, was agitated,
resounded and rumbled.And all the realms of Mara were stirred up and discomfited.All
the grasses, shrubs, herbs and trees in the great trichiliocosm bent in the direction of
the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata.(517) Flowers came up out of season.From high up in the air
a great rain of flowers came down.And Shakra, Chief of Gods, and the Four Great Kings scattered
and poured heavenly sandalwood powder and heavenly flowers over the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata,and
said: “Well spoken, son of good family.Through your might we have heard a sermon
which has issued from ultimate reality, which is contrary to the whole world, and which
gives no ground to any of those beings who are established in any of the views which involve
the assumption of an individuality, or who have settled down in any of the views which
assume the existence of something that is not.”

Sadaprarudita then asked Dharmodgata: “What is the cause, what is the reason why this great
earthquake is manifested in the world?” Dharmodgata: In consequence of your asking for this
disquisition on the not-coming and not-going of the Tathagatas, and through my exposition
of it, eight thousand living beings have acquired the patient acceptance of dharmas which
fail to be produced,eighty niyutas of living beings have raised their hearts to full enlightenment,
and of sixty-four thousand living beings has the dispassionate, unstained dharma-eye
been purified for the vision of dharmas.
