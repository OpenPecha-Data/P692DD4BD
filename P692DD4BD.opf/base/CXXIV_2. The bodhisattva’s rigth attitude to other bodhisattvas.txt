2. The bodhisattva’s rigth attitude to other bodhisattvasAnanda: Can he escape from those attitudes
of mind, or is he definitely condemned to go on putting on the armour for all that
length of time? The Lord: I have, Ananda, demonstrated a dharma which includes the possibility
of escape, - for persons of the Disciple-vehicle, for persons of the Pratyekabuddha-vehicle,
for persons of the Bodhisattva-vehicle.As to the person who belongs to the vehicle
of the Bodhisattvas and who has quarrelled with someone else who also belongs to the vehicle
of the Bodhisattvas, - if he does not confess his fault, does not promise restraint in
future, harbours a latent bias towards hate, and dwells tied to that bias, - of that person
I do not teach the escape [i.e. from the consequences of his action],but he is definitely
condemned to go on putting on the armour for all that length of time.But I teach his escape
if he confesses his fault, promises restraint in future, and reflects as follows: “I
whose duty it is to drive away, to pacify and appease the quarrels, disputes and conflicts
of all beings, yet I myself engage in disputes!It is indeed a loss to me, and not a gain,
that I should answer back as I am spoken to.When I should be to all beings a bridge across
the sea of birth-and-death, I nevertheless say to another, ‘the same to you,’ or return
a harsh and rough answer.This is not the way in which I should speak.In fights, quarrels
and disputes I should behave like a senseless idiot, or like a dumb sheep. When I hear someone
using offensive, abusive, insulting words towards me, my heart should not cherish malice
for others.It is not (422) meet and proper for me to perceive the faults of others,or
to think that what is being said about the faults of others is worth listening to.For I, since
I am earnestly intent [on full enlightenment], should not do harm to others. When I should
make all beings happy by giving them everything that brings happiness, when I should
lead them to Nirvana after having won full enlightenment, - yet nevertheless I bear ill will!I
should not bear ill will even against those who have offended against me,and I must
avoid getting into a rage,and I must make a firm effort in that direction.Even when my life
is in danger I must not get into a rage, and no frown should appear on my face.”Of such
a Bodhisattva I teach the escape.This is the attitude which a Bodhisattva should adopt also
towards persons who belong to the vehicle of the Disciples. Never to get angry with any
being, that is the attitude of mind one should adopt towards all beings.What attitude then
should a Bodhisattva have towards other persons belonging to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas?
The same as towards the Teacher.He should have the attitude that “these Bodhisattvas
are my teachers.”Surely, they have mounted on the same vehicle as I, have ascended by the
same path, are of like intention with me, have set out in the same vehicle as I.Wherein they
should be trained, that is the method by which I should be trained.But if some of them
dwell in a dwelling contaminated [by the ideas of Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas], (423) then
I should not do likewise.If, however they dwell in an uncontaminated dwelling, in mental
activities associated with all-knowledge, then I also should train as they do.No obstacles
to full enlightenment can arise to a Bodhisattva who trains himself in this way in all-knowledge,
and he quickly knows full enlightenment.
