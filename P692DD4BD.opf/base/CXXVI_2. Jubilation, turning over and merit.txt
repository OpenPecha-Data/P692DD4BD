2. Jubilation, turning over and meritThe son or daughter of good family who rejoices at the
productions of thought of those Bodhisattvas who have just begun to set out in the vehicle,
as well as at the productions of thought of those who progress on the course, as well as
at the irreversible nature of those who are irreversible, as well as at the nature of those
who are bound to one more birth only, - to what extent is their merit a superior one? The
Lord: One might be able, Kausika, to grasp the measure of Sumeru, king of mountains, or
of a world system, up to a great trichiliocosm, with the help of a tip of straw, but one
could not possibly grasp the measure of the merit coming to that son or daughter of good family,
or to a Bodhisattva, from the production of a thought connected with that jubilation.

(436) Sakra: Beset by Mara are those beings who do not come to hear of this immeasurable merit
of that jubilation over the career of Bodhisattva - which begins with the first thought
of enlightenment and which ends with full enlightenment – who do not know it, who do not
see it, who do not bring that jubilation to mind.They are partisans of Mara,deceased in Mara’s
realms.For those who have brought to mind those thoughts, who have turned them over into
the supreme enlightenment, have rejoiced at them, they have done so in order to shatter
Mara’s realm.One should, O Lord, rejoice at the various stages of the thought which the
Bodhisattvas have raised to enlightenment.(437) Sons and daughters of good family who have
not abandoned the Tathagata, and the Dharma, and the Community, they should rejoice in those
stages of the thought of enlightenment!

The Lord: So it is, Kausika.And those sons or daughters of good family who have rejoiced in
the stages of the thought of enlightenment, they shall – whether they belong to the vehicle
of the Bodhisattvas, or that of the Pratyekabuddhas, or that of the Disciples – soon please
the Tathagatas, and not displease them.Sakra: So it is, O Lord.Therefore, wherever they
may be reborn as a result of the wholesome roots [they have planted] when their hearts were
filled with jubilation, there they shall be treated with respect, revered, worshipped
and adored.They shall never see any unpleasant sights, nor hear any unpleasant sounds,[(cm
:: Schlosser: The reference to sounds is missing in Vaidya’s and Wogihara’s edition.)]nor
smell any unpleasant smells,nor taste any unpleasant tastes,(438) nor come into contact with
anything unpleasant to the touch.One must expect them to be reborn in the heavens, and
not in the places of woe.For they have rejoiced in the wholesome roots of countless beings,
roots which bring happiness to all beings. The thoughts of jubilation of those who, after
they have produced an urge towards enlightenment, have rejoiced over the successive stages
of the thought of enlightenment in persons who belong to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas,
shall, as they grow, become the nourishers of full enlightenment.After they have won full
enlightenment, they also shall lead countless beings to Nirvana.The Lord: So it is, Kausika,
as you have said it, through the Tathagata’s might.The wholesome roots of countless
beings are rejoiced over, planted and consummated as a consequence of the action of a son
or daughter of good family who has rejoiced over the successive stages of the thought of
enlightenment in those persons who belong to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas.
