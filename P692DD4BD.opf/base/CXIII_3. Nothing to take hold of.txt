3. Nothing to take hold ofSubhuti: Deep, O Lord, is perfect wisdom.Certainly as a great enterprise
it has been set up.The Lord: So it is, Subhuti.For all-knowledge has been entrusted
to it, and so has the level of a Pratyekabuddha and the level of all the Disciples.An anointed
king, a Kshatriya, who feels strong and secure in his kingdom, entrusts all his business
concerning his kingly office, and the city and the kingdom to his minister,and he himself
has few cares and his burden is light.Just so, whatever dharmas of Buddhas, Pratyekabuddhas,
or Disciples there may be, they are all entrusted to the perfection of wisdom.It is
the perfection of wisdom which in them does the work.It is in this manner that perfect wisdom
has set up for a great enterprise, i.e. so that one should not take hold of form, etc.,
nor settle down in it.And as for the skandhas,so also for the fruits of the holy life,
from the fruit of a Streamwinner to the state of all-knowledge.

Subhuti: In what way has perfect wisdom been set up so that one should not take hold of the
state of all-knowledge, nor settle down in it? (282) The Lord: Do you view Arhatship as a
real dharma which you could take hold of, or settle down in? Subhuti: No, Lord!The Lord: So
it is, Subhuti.I also do not view Tathagatahood as real,and therefore I do not take hold
of it, do not settle down in it.For that reason all-knowledge also is a state in which one
neither takes hold of anything, nor settles down in anything.Subhuti: Bodhisattvas who have
but newly set out in the vehicle, and whose wholesome roots are but small, must beware
that they do not tremble when they hear this exposition.On the other hand, Bodhisattvas will,
on hearing this deep perfection of wisdom, firmly believe in it if they are suitable
for Buddhahood, have fulfilled their duties under the Jinas of the past, and have planted
wholesome roots for a long time.The Lord: So it is, Subhuti.
