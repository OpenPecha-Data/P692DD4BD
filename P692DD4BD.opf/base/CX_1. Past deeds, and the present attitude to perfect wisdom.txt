1. Past deeds, and the present attitude to perfect wisdomThereupon it occurred to Sakra, Chief
of Gods: Those who come to hear of this perfection of wisdom must be people who have fulfilled
their duties under the former Jinas, who have planted wholesome roots under many Buddhas,
who have been taken hold of by good friends.How much more so those who take up this
perfection of wisdom, bear it in mind, study, spread and explain it,and who, in addition,
train in Thusness, progress to Thusness, make efforts about Thusness.They are endowed with
more than trifling wholesome roots.They will be people who have honoured many Buddhas,and
who have again and again questioned them.It was just this perfection of wisdom which they
have heard in the past in the presence of former Tathagatas.They have planted wholesome
roots under many Buddhas, (209) those sons and daughters of good family who, when just this
perfection of wisdom being taught, explained and repeated, will not become cowed nor stolid,
will not become cast down nor depressed, will not turn their minds away from it nor
have their backs broken, will not tremble, be frightened, be terrified.

Sariputra read Sakra’s thoughts, and said: Like an irreversible Bodhisattva should one regard
that person who, when just this deep perfection of wisdom is being taught and explained,
has faith in it, and, trusting, firmly believing, his heart full of serene faith, raises
a thought directed towards enlightenment, takes up, etc., this perfection of wisdom, trains
in Thusness, progresses to Thusness, makes efforts about Thusness.For this perfection of
wisdom is deep, O Lord,and therefore someone with diminutive wholesome roots, who, unwilling
to ask questions, has learned nothing when face to face with the Buddhas and Lords in
the past, and who has not practised in the past, cannot just here believe in this so deep
perfection of wisdom.And as to those who neither believe in it nor understand it, and who
decide to reject it, (210) in the past also they have rejected this deep perfection of wisdom
when it was taught,and that in consequence of the inadequacy of their wholesome roots.For
those who have not practised in the past cannot believe in this perfection of wisdom.When
they reject it now, they have also rejected it in the past.And that is the reason why,
when this deep perfection of wisdom is being taught, they have no faith, or patience, or
pleasure, or desire-to-do, or vigour, or vigilance, or resolve. And in the past also they
have questioned neither the Buddhas, the Lords, nor their disciples.

Sakra: Deep, O holy Sariputra, is the perfection of wisdom.It is not at all astonishing that,
when it is being taught, a Bodhisattva would not believe in it, if he had not practised
in the past. Sakra then said to the Lord: I pay homage, O Lord, to the perfection of wisdom!One
pays homage to the cognition of the all-knowing when one pays homage to the perfection
of wisdom.The Lord: So it is.For from it has come forth the all-knowledge of the Buddhas,
the Lords, (211) and, conversely, the perfection of wisdom is brought about as something
that has come forth from the cognition of the all-knowing.That is why one should course,stand,progress,and
make efforts in this perfection of wisdom.

Sakra: How does a Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, become one who has stood in the
perfection of wisdom? How does he make efforts about the perfection of wisdom? The Lord:
Well said, well said, Kausika.Well said, again, well said, Kausika, since you have decided
to question the Tathagata about this matter.In that you have been inspired by the Buddha’s
might.Here, Kausika, a Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom does not stand in form,
etc.,does not stand in the notion that ‘this is form,’ and that means that he makes efforts
about form, etc.He does not apply himself to the notion that ‘this is form, etc.’ Insofar
as he does not apply himself to the notion that ‘this is form, etc.,’ he does not stand
in the notion that ‘this is form, etc.’ (212,1)Thus he becomes one who has stood in perfect
wisdom,thus he makes efforts.

Sariputra: Deep, O Lord, is the perfection of wisdom.Hard to fathom is the perfection of wisdom.Hard
to grasp is the perfection of wisdom.Unlimited is the perfection of wisdom.The Lord:
So it is, Sariputra.He does not stand in the notion that ‘form, etc., is deep.’Insofar
as he does not stand in this notion he makes efforts about form, etc.He does not make efforts
about the notion that ‘form , etc., is deep.’In so far as he makes no efforts about this
notion he does not stand in the notion that ‘form, etc., is deep.’
