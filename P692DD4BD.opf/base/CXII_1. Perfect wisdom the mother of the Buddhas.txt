1. Perfect wisdom the mother of the BuddhasThe Lord: It is as with a mother who has many children,
- five, or ten, or twenty, or thirty, or forty, or fifty, or one hundred, or one thousand.If
she fell ill, they would all exert themselves to prevent their mother from dying,
to keep her alive as long as possible, to keep pain and unpleasantness away from her body.Because
they are aware that to her they owe their existence,that in great pain she has brought
them into the world, that she has instructed them in the ways of the world.They would
therefore look well after her, give her everything that can make her happy, protect her
well, make much of her, and they will hope that she be free from pain - derived from contact
with eye, ear, nose, tongue, body or mind, or coming from wind, bile, phlegm, or a disorder
of the humours, or from stinging insects, mosquitoes, or crawling animals, from men
or from ghosts, from anything falling upon her, or tearing her asunder, or from a disastrous
crash.(254) In this way those sons honour their mother by giving her all that can make
her happy, make much of her, cherish and protect her, because they are aware that she is their
mother and begetter, that, in great pain, she brought them into the world, that she instructed
them in the ways of the world.In just this same way the Tathagatas bring this perfection
of wisdom to mind,and it is through their might, sustaining power and grace that
people write, learn, study, spread and repeat it.And also the Tathagatas who dwell in other
world systems just now, - for the weal and happiness of the many, out of pity for the many,
for the weal and happiness of a great body of people, from pity for Gods, men and all
beings - they also all bring this perfection of wisdom to mind, and they put forth zeal so
that this perfection of wisdom may last long, so that it may not be destroyed, so that Mara
and his host may not prevent this perfection of wisdom from being taught, written, and
practised.So fond are the Tathagatas of this perfection of wisdom, so much do they cherish
and protect it.For she is their mother and begetter,she showed them this all-knowledge, she
instructed them in ways of the world.From her have the Tathagatas come forth.For she has
begotten and shown that cognition of the all-knowing, she has shown them the world for what
it really is.(255) The all-knowledge of the Tathagatas has come forth from her.All the
Tathagatas, past, future, and present, win full enlightenment thanks to this very perfection
of wisdom.It is in this sense that the perfection of wisdom generates the Tathagatas,
and instructs them in this world.
