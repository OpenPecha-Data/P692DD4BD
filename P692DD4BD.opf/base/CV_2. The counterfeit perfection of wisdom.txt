2. The counterfeit perfection of wisdomSakra: Can one then expound this perfection of wisdom?
The Lord: Yes, one should expound it to someone who does not understand it.For in the future
a counterfeit of the perfection of wisdom will arise.When he hears it, a person who does
not understand should beware of making obeisance to it, if he wants to win full enlightenment.

Sakra: How should he recognize in the future if and when the counterfeit perfection of wisdom
is expounded? (113) The Lord: In the future there will be some monks whose bodies are undeveloped,
whose moral conduct, thought and wisdom are undeveloped, who are stupid, dumb like
sheep, without wisdom.When they announce that they will expound the perfection of wisdom,
they will actually expound its counterfeit.They will expound the counterfeit perfection
of wisdom by teaching that the impermanence of form, etc., is to be interpreted as the destruction
of form, etc.To strive for that insight, that, according to them, will be the coursing
in the perfection of wisdom.But on the contrary, one should not view the impermanence
of form, etc., as the destruction of form, etc.For to view things in that way means to
course in the counterfeit perfection of wisdom.For that reason, Kausika, should one expound
the meaning of the perfection of wisdom.By expounding it one would beget the greater merit.
