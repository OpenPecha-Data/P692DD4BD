1. End of the story of SadapraruditaIn conjunction with the acquisition of the six million concentration
doors, the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita saw the Buddhas and Lords, - in all the
ten directions in countless trichiliocosms â€“ surrounded by their congregations of monks, accompanied
by multitudes of Bodhisattvas, teaching just this perfection of wisdom, through
just these methods, in just these words, in just these letters,even as I just now in this
great trichiliocosm demonstrate dharma, - surrounded by the congregation of monks, accompanied
by multitudes of Bodhisattvas, and teaching just this perfection of wisdom, through
just these methods, in just these words, in just these letters.He became endowed with inconceivable
learning and a sacred knowledge vast like the ocean. In all his births he never
again was deprived of the Buddha.He was reborn only where he could be face to face with the
Buddhas, the Lords.Even in his dreams he was not lacking in the Buddhas, the Lords.All unfortunate
rebirths he had abandoned, and he had secured the circumstances which allowed him
to accomplish one auspicious rebirth after another.
