3. Non-attachmentSubhuti: Deep is the essential original nature of the dharmas.The Lord: Because
it is isolated.Subhuti: Deep is the essential nature of perfect wisdom.The Lord: Because
its essential nature is pure and isolated,therefore has the perfection of wisdom a deep
essential nature.Subhuti: Isolated is the essential nature of perfect wisdom.I pay homage
to the perfection of wisdom.

The Lord: Also all dharmas are isolated in their essential nature.And the isolatedness of the
essential nature of all dharmas is identical with the perfection of wisdom.For the Tathagata
has fully known all dharmas as not made.Subhuti: Therefore all dharmas have the character
of not having fully known by the Tathagata? The Lord: It is just through their essential
nature that those dharmas are not a something.Their nature is no-nature, and their no-nature
is their nature. Because all dharmas have one mark only, i.e. no mark.It is for this
reason that all dharmas have the character of not having been fully known by the Tathagata.For
there are no two natures of dharma,but just one single one is the nature of all dharmas.And
the nature of all dharmas is not nature, and their no-nature is their nature.It is
thus that all those points of attachment are abandoned.

(193) Subhuti: Deep, O Lord, is the perfection of wisdom.The Lord: Through a depth like that
of space.Subhuti: Hard to understand, O Lord, is the perfection of wisdom.The Lord: Because
nothing is fully known by the enlightened.Subhuti: Unthinkable, O Lord, is the perfection
of wisdom.The Lord: Because the perfection of wisdom is not something that thought ought
to know, or that thought has access to.Subhuti: Not something made is the perfection of
wisdom, O Lord.The Lord: Because no maker can be apprehended.

Subhuti: How then under these circumstances, should a Bodhisattva course in perfect wisdom?
The Lord: A Bodhisattva courses in perfect wisdom if, while coursing, he does not course in
the skandhas;or if he does not course in the conviction that the skandhas are impermanent,or
that they are empty,or that they are neither defective nor entire (194,1).And if he does
not even course in the conviction that form is not the defectiveness or entirety of form,
and so for the other skandhas, then he courses in perfect wisdom.

Subhuti: It is wonderful, O Lord, how well the reasons for the attachment and non-attachment
of the Bodhisattvas have been explained.The Lord: One courses in perfect wisdom if one does
not course in the idea that form is with attachment, or without attachment.And as for form,
so for the other skandhas,the sight organ, etc.,to feeling born from eye contact;so for
the physical elements,the six perfections,the thirty-seven wings of enlightenment, the
powers, the grounds of self-confidence, the analytical knowledges, the eighteen special Buddha-dharmas,and
the fruits of the holy life, from the fruit of a Streamwinner to all-knowledge.(195)
When he courses thus, a Bodhisattva does not generate attachment to anything,
from form to all-knowledge.For all-knowledge is unattached, it is neither bound nor freed,
and there is nothing that has risen above it.It is thus, Subhuti, that Bodhisattvas should
course in perfect wisdom through rising completely above all attachments. (196,1)
