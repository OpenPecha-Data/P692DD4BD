3. Various deeds of MaraMoreover, Subhuti, when this perfection of wisdom is being taught, demonstrated,
explained, learned, recited, repeated, or even merely written down, many flashes
of insight will come up in bewildering multitude, and they will make for confusion of
thought.This also has been done by Mara to these Bodhisattvas.

Subhuti: Is it at all possible to write down the perfection of wisdom? The Lord: No, Subhuti.It
is also a deed of Mara if after one has written down the perfection of wisdom, one should
either think that it is the perfection of wisdom which is written down, or that it is
not the perfection of wisdom which is written down, or if one should adhere to the perfection
of wisdom either in the letters, or as something not in the letters.

– Moreover, Subhuti, while they write down the perfection of wisdom, their minds are on all
sorts of things: places, villages, towns, cities, country districts, nations, royal cities,
pleasure groves, preceptors, (241) tales, robbers, bathing places, streets, palanquins,
occasions for happiness, occasions for fear, women, men, neuters, unsuitable situations, mother
and father, brothers and sisters, friends, maternal relatives, kinsmen, chief wives,
sons and daughters, houses, food and drink, clothes, beds, seats, livelihood, obligations,
occasions of greed, hate and delusion, on right times, lucky times, unlucky times, on songs,
music, dances, poems, plays, treatises, business, jokes, musical shows, sorrows, troubles,
and themselves. These and other acts of attention Mara, the Evil One, will arrange when
this perfection of wisdom is being taught, studied, or merely written down, and thus he
will cause obstacles and confusion of thought to the Bodhisattvas.A Bodhisattva should recognize
this as a deed of Mara,and avoid it.(242) In addition, his thoughts may also be on
kings, royal princes, elephants, horses, chariots and troops of soldiers.Also that has been
done to him by Mara.In addition, his thoughts may be on fire, temptations, money, corn
and affluence.This also Mara has done to him.

Moreover, difficulties will arise about gain, honour, robes, alms-bowl, lodging, and medicinal
appliances for use in sickness, or alternatively, thoughts relishing gain, honour and fame
may torment the Bodhisattvas who teach, explain, repeat or merely write this perfection
of wisdom.This also Mara does to them.They should recognize and avoid these deeds of Mara.

Furthermore, Mara, the Evil One, will come to where Bodhisattvas teach, etc., this perfection
of wisdom, and he will bring along the very deep Sutras which are associated with the level
of Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas. He will advise them that they should “train in this,
write, expound, and repeat this, for from it all-knowledge will be created.” (243,1)But a
Bodhisattva who is skilled in means should not long for those Sutras.For although they teach
Emptiness, the Signless and the Wishless, nevertheless they do not announce the skill
in means of the Bodhisattvas.A Bodhisattva who remains without the higher knowledge of the
distinction of the cognition of the cognition of skill in means spurns this deep perfection
of wisdom,and seeks instead for skill in means in the Sutras associated with the level
of Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas.This also should be known as Mara’s deed to a Bodhisattva.
