1. PreambleAt that time again, many Gods came to that assembly, and took their seats: Sakra,
Chief of Gods, with forty thousand Gods of the Thirty-three; the four world-guardians, with
twenty thousand Gods belonging to the retinue of the four Great Kings; Brahma, ruler of
this world system, with ten thousand Gods belonging to the company of Brahma;and five thousand
Gods of the Pure Abode.But the might of the Buddha, his majesty and authority surpassed
even the splendour of the Gods, a reward for the deeds they had done in the past.

Sakra: These many thousands of Gods, Subhuti, have come to this assembly, and taken their seats,
because they want to hear about perfect wisdom from the Holy Subhuti, and to listen to
his advice to the Bodhisattvas, to his instruction and admonition.How then should a Bodhisattva
stand in perfect wisdom, how train in it, how devote himself to it? Subhuti: Let me
then explain it to you, through the Buddhaâ€™s might, majesty and authority.Those Gods, who
have not yet aspired to full enlightenment should do so.Those, however, who are certain
that they have got safely out of this world [i.e., the Arhats who have reached their last
birth, and think they have done with it all] are unfit for full enlightenment [because they
are not willing to go, from compassion, back into birth-and-death].And why? The flood of
birth-and-death hems them in.(34) Incapable of repeated rebirths, they are unable to aspire
to full enlightenment. And yet, if they also will aspire to full enlightenment, I confirm
them also.I shall not obstruct their wholesome root.For one should uphold the most distinguished
dharmas above all others.

The Lord: Well said, Subhuti. You do well to encourage the Bodhisattvas.Subhuti then said to
the Lord: We should be grateful to the Lord, and not ungrateful.For in the past the Lord
has, in the presence of the Tathagatas of the past, led, for our sake, the holy life with
enlightenment as his aim. Even after he had definitely become a Bodhisattva [a being dedicated
to enlightenment], disciples still instructed and admonished him in the perfections,
and by his coursing therein he has produced the utmost cognition.Even so also we should help,
champion, aid and sustain the Bodhisattvas.Because the Bodhisattvas, if we help, champion,
aid and sustain them, will soon know full enlightenment.
