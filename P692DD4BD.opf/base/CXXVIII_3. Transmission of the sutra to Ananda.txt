3. Transmission of the sutra to AnandaTherefore then, Ananda, again and again I entrust and
transmit to you this perfection of wisdom, laid out in letters, so that it may be available
for learning, for bearing in mind, preaching, studying and spreading wide, so that it may
last long, so that it may not disappear.If, Ananda, you should again forget all the demonstrations
of dharma which you have learned directly from Me – the perfection of wisdom alone
being excepted – should cast them away, and allow them to be forgotten, that would be
but a slight offence against Me.But if you should forget, cast away and allow to be forgotten
only one verse of the perfection of wisdom, or merely a part of a verse, that would be
a very serious (461) offence against Me, and it would displease Me greatly.And if, after
you have learned the perfection of wisdom, you again forget it, cast it away, allow it to
be forgotten, then you fail in the respect, reverence and worship which you owe to Me,and
to the other Buddhas and Lords, past, future and present.Therefore, Ananda, remember that
it would be a serious offence against Me if, after you had learned the perfection of wisdom,
you should again forget it, cast it away, and allow it to be forgotten, and that would
greatly displease Me.For the Tathagata has said that “the perfection of wisdom is the mother,
the creator, the genetrix of the past, future and present Tathagatas, their nurse in all-knowledge.”Therefore
then, Ananda, do I entrust and transmit to you this perfection of
wisdom, so that it might not disappear.This perfection of wisdom should be learned, should
be borne in mind, studied, repeated, written and developed.You should attend well to this
perfection of wisdom, bear it well in mind, study it well, and spread it well.And when one
learns it, one should carefully analyze it grammatically, letter by letter, syllable by
syllable, word by word.(462) For as the dharma-body of the past, future and present Tathagatas
is this dharma-text authoritative.In the same way in which you, Ananda, behave towards
Me who at present reside as a Tathagata – with solicitude, affection, respect and helpfulness
- just so, with the same solicitude, affection and respect, and in the same virtuous
spirit, should you learn this perfection of wisdom, bear it in mind, study, repeat, write
and develop it, respect, revere and worship it.That is the way for you to worship Me,that
is the way to show affection, serene faith and respect for the past, future and present Buddhas
and Lords.If Ananda, I, the Tathagata, am dear and pleasant to you, and you do not
abandon Me, may thereby this perfection of wisdom become dear and pleasant to you, and may
you not abandon it, so that you may not forget even one single word of it, so that it may
not disappear.For long could I speak to you about this bestowal of the perfection of wisdom,
for one kalpa, or for the remainder of a kalpa, for one hundred kalpas, for up to hundreds
of thousands of kotis of kalpas, and more.But, to cut it short, in the same way in which
I am your teacher, so is the perfection of wisdom.In the same way in which the past, future
and present Buddhas and Lords are the teachers of the world with its Gods, men and Asuras,
just so is the perfection of wisdom.Therefore then, Ananda, (463) with a measureless
bestowal I entrust and transmit to you the perfection of wisdom, which itself is measureless,
for the benefit and happiness of the world with its Gods, men and Asuras.If one does
not want to abandon the Tathagata, or the Dharma, or the Samgha, if one does not want to
abandon the enlightenment of the past, future and present Buddhas and Lords, - may one not
abandon the perfection of wisdom!And there is this further admonitionthat those who learn
this perfection of wisdom, bear it in mind, study, repeat, write and develop it, they assist
in the enlightenment of the past, future and present Buddhas and Lords.For, whoever assists
this perfection of wisdom when it is crumbling away, he assists the enlightenment of
the past, future and present Buddhas and Lords.Because from the perfection of wisdom has
the enlightenment of the Buddhas and Lords come forth.And that holds good of all the Tathagatas,
whether past,future or present.Therefore, a Bodhisattva who wants to know full enlightenment
and to train in the six perfections should listen to this perfection of wisdom,
study, repeat and write it, (464,1)and he should train in this very perfection of wisdom,
and make endeavours about it.For this perfection of wisdom is the mother, creator and genetrix
of the Bodhisattvas.It is thanks to the perfection of wisdom that any Bodhisattvas ever
train in the six perfections, and at any time go forth to full enlightenment.It is thanks
to just this perfection of wisdom that they all go forth in the six perfections.Because
all the perfections come to nourish the supreme enlightenment after they have come forth
from the perfection of wisdom.Therefore then, Ananda, again and again, for a second time,
for a third time, do I entrust and transmit this perfection of wisdom to you, so that it might
not disappear.For this perfection of wisdom is the inexhaustible storehouse of dharma
for the Tathagatas.The dharma which the Buddhas and Lords have demonstrated to beings in
the past period, in the world of birth-and-death which has no beginning or end, all that came
from just this storehouse of dharma, from the perfection of wisdom.And also the dharma
which the Buddhas and Lords will, after their full enlightenment, demonstrate to beings in
the future period, in the measureless world of birth-and-death, also that will come from
just this storehouse of dharma, from the perfection of wisdom.And also the Buddhas and Lords
who just now reside in countless world systems, and demonstrate dharma, they also have
derived their revelation from just this storehouse of dharma, from the perfection of wisdom.Inexhaustible
therefore is this storehouse of dharma, the perfection of wisdom.[464a] If,
Ananda, you should demonstrate dharma on the Disciple-level to persons belonging to the
vehicle of the Disciples, and if as a result of your demonstration of dharma all the beings
in the great trichiliocosm would realize Arhatship, you would not have done your duty as
My disciple if in that way you would keep moving after Me the wheel of dharma, and demonstrate
dharma.But if, on the other hand, you would demonstrate and reveal but one single verse
of the dharma associated with the perfection of wisdom to a Bodhisattva, then I should
be pleased with you, who as My disciple turns after Me the wheel of dharma, and demonstrates
dharma.If you consider that demonstration of dharma of yours through which the beings
in the great trichiliocosm have all been induced to attain Arhatship, and of those Arhats
the meritorious work founded on giving, on morality, and on meditational development, would
all that constitute a great heap of merit?Ananda: It would, O Lord.The Lord: A person belonging
to the vehicle of the Disciples begets a greater merit than that if he demonstrates
to Bodhisattvas the dharma associated with the perfection of wisdom. The merit is still
greater if it is a Bodhisattva who demonstrates to another Bodhisattva [a verse of] dharma
associated with the perfection of wisdom,- for even one single day only, for a morning,for
an hour, for half an hour, for a minute, nay for a second, for a moment, for the incidence
of a single moment.For the gift of dharma on the part of a Bodhisattva surpasses all the
wholesome roots of all those who belong to the vehicle of the Disciples or Pratyekabuddhas.It
is quite impossible that a Bodhisattva who is thus endowed with wholesome roots, who
thus brings to mind that wholesome root, could possibly turn away from full enlightenment.
That cannot be.
