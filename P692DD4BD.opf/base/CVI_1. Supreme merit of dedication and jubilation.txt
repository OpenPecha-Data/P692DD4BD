1. Supreme merit of dedication and jubilationMaitreya: On the one side we have, on the part
of a Bodhisattva, the meritorious work which is founded on his rejoicing at the merit of others,
and on his dedication of that merit to the utmost enlightenment of all beings; on the
other side there is, on the part of all beings, the meritorious work founded on giving,
on morality, on meditational development. Among these the meritorious work of a Bodhisattva
founded on jubilation and dedication is declared to be the best, the most excellent and
sublime, the highest and supreme, with none above it, unequalled, equalling the unequalled.
