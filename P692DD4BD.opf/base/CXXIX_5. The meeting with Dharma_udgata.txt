5. The meeting with DharmodgataIt was thus that the merchant’s daughter set out to worship and
honour the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata.

(505) She took five hundred carriagesand ordered her five hundred servant girls to get ready.She
took abundant riches, and ample provisions, mounted one carriage together with the Bodhisattva
Sadaprarudita, and proceeded East, surrounded by the five hundred maidens on their
five hundred carts, accompanied by a huge retinue, and preceded by her parents.After some
time the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita saw the city of Gandhavati from afar.In the middle of
the marketplace he saw the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata on his pulpit, demonstrating dharma,
surrounded and revered by an assembly of many hundreds, of many thousands, of many hundreds
of thousands.The moment he saw him he was filled with that kind of happiness (506) which
a monk feels when with one-pointed attention he has obtained the first trance.He looked upon
him and thought to himself: “It would not be seemly for me to approach the Bodhisattva
Dharmodgata seated on a carriage.Let me therefore alight from it!”Thereupon he alighted from
his carriage,and the merchant’s daughter with her five hundred maidens followed suit.Sadaprarudita,
with the merchant’s daughter and her five hundred maidens then went up to where
the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata sat amidst a magnificent display of religious aspirations.

For the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata had at that time created, for the perfection of wisdom, a pointed
tower, made of the seven precious substances, adorned with red sandalwood, and encircled
by an ornament of pearls.Gems were placed into the four corners of the pointed tower,
and performed the functions of lamps.Four incense jars made of silver were suspended on its
four sides, and pure black aloe wood was burning in them, as a token of worship for the
perfection of wisdom.And in the middle of that pointed tower a couch made of the seven precious
things was put up, and on it a box made of four large gems.Into that the perfection
of wisdom was placed, written with melted vaidurya on golden tablets.And that pointed tower
was adorned with brightly coloured garlands which hung down in strips.

The Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita and the merchant’s daughter with her five hundred maidens looked
upon that pointed tower, so magnificently decorated as a display of religious aspirations.They
saw thousands of Gods, with Sakra, Chief of Gods, scattering over that pointed tower
heavenly Mandarava flowers, heavenly sandalwood powder, heavenly gold dust, and heavenly
silver dust, (507,1)and they heard the music of heavenly instruments.Sadaprarudita then
asked Sakra, Chief of Gods: “For what purpose do you, together with many thousands of Gods,
scatter over that pointed tower, which consists of precious substances, heavenly Mandarava
flowers, etc., and why do the Devas up in space play heavenly music or their instruments?”
Sakra answered: “Do you not know the reason, son of good family? This is the perfection
of wisdom, the mother and guide of the Bodhisattvas. When Bodhisattvas train in it, they
soon reach the perfection of all qualities, and, consequent on that, all the dharmas of a
Buddha and the knowledge of all modes.”Sadaprarudita replied: “Where is this perfection of
wisdom, the mother and guide of the Bodhisattva?” Sakra answered: “The holy Bodhisattva
Dharmodgata has placed it in the middle of this pointed tower, after he had written it on
golden tablets with melted Vaidurya, and sealed it with seven seals.We cannot easily show
it to you.”Thereupon the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita and the merchant’s daughter, with her five
hundred maidens, all paid worship to the perfection of wisdom – with the flowers which
they had brought along, and with garlands, wreaths, raiment, jewels, incense, flags and golden
and silvery flowers (508) and, one after another, they deposited their portion in front
of it, for the greater honour of the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata.

They then worshipped the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata by scattering flowers, etc., over him, and
played heavenly music on their instruments – motivated by a desire to worship dharma.

The flowers then rose high above the head of the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata and formed a pointed
tower of flowers.And those flowers of various colours, golden and silvery, stood high in
the air, like a canopy.And also the robes, raiment and jewels stood high up in the air, like
a pavilion in the clouds.When the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita and the merchant’s daughter
with her five hundred maidens beheld this wonder,they thought to themselves: “It is wonderful
to see how much wonderworking power this Bodhisattva Dharmodgata possesses, how great
a might, how great an influence.So far he courses but in the course of a Bodhisattva, and
now already he possesses so much power to work wonders. How much more will he have after
he has known full enlightenment!” (509,1)

The merchant’s daughter and the five hundred maidens thereupon felt a longing for the Bodhisattva
Dharmodgata. All of one mind, they resolutely raised their hearts to the supreme enlightenment,
and said: “May we, through this wholesome root, become Tathagatas in a future
period!May we come to course in the course of Bodhisattvas, and may we receive those very
dharmas which this Bodhisattva Dharmodgata has received!And may we just so honour and respect
the perfection of wisdom as this Bodhisattva Dharmodgata honours and respects it,and may
we reveal it to the many just as he has done!And may we become as endowed with perfect
wisdom and skill in means,and as accomplished in them as this Bodhisattva Dharmodgata is!”

The Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita, and the merchant’s daughter with her five hundred maidens, after
they had worshipped the perfection of wisdom and honored the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata with
their heads, respectfully saluted him with their folded hands, and stood on one side.The
Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita then told the whole story of his quest for the perfection of
wisdom, beginning with the voice he had heard in the forest, that bid him go East.(510) He
told Dharmodgata how he had stood in many concentrations,and how the Buddhas and Lords of
the ten directions had comforted and applauded him, and had said: “Well done, son of good
family! These concentrations have issued from the perfection of wisdom. By firmly standing
in the perfection of wisdom have we achieved all the dharmas of a Buddha.”He went on to
relate that: “The Tathagatas then vanished again,and I emerged from that state of concentration.I
then asked myself ‘wherefrom now did these Tathagatas come, and whither have they
gone?’ I thought to myself that ‘the holy Bodhisattva Dharmodgata has received the dharanis,
(511) he possesses the five superknowledges, he has done his duties under the Jinas of
the past, he has planted wholesome roots, and is well trained in perfect wisdom and skill
in means.He will explain to me this matter as it really is, and tell me where those Tathagatas
have come from and whither they have gone to.’Now I have come to you,and I ask you, son
of good family: ‘Where have those Tathagatas come from, and whither have they gone to?’
Demonstrate to me, son of good family, the coming and going of those Tathagatas, so that
we may cognize it, and so that we may become not lacking in the vision of the Tathagatas.”
