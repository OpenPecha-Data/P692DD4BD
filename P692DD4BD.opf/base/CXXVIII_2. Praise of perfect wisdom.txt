2. Praise of perfect wisdomTherefore then, Ananda, Bodhisattvas who want to dwell in the highest
dwelling, who want to dwell in the dwelling of the Tathagata, should dwell in the dwelling
of perfect wisdom.And with any Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom one can be
quite certain that he had, before he was reborn here among men, deceased among menor among
the heavenly hosts of the Tushitas.For it is among men and the Tushita Gods that this perfection
of wisdom circulates in its full extent.One can be certain that the Tathagatas behold
those Bodhisattvas who course in this perfection of wisdom, who learn it, bear it in mind,
study, preach, repeat, or merely write it, and who also instruct the other Bodhisattvas,
admonish, instigate and encourage them.One should know that they have planted wholesome
roots with the Tathagatas.They have not only in the presence of Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas
planted wholesome roots so as to train in perfect wisdom, but, without any doubt, those
Bodhisattvas who train in this perfection of wisdom and remain unafraid, they have planted
wholesome roots with the Tathagatas.(460) Those who take up this perfection of wisdom,
bear it in mind, study, preach, repeat and write it, who pursue it, -its meaning, contents
and method â€“ one should be quite certain that they have been face to face with Tathagatas.If
Bodhisattvas do not revile this perfection of wisdom, do not oppose, deny or reject
it, then one should know that they have fulfilled their duties under the Jinas of the past.

But if a Bodhisattva does not go back on his vow to win full enlightenment, then he does not
give the wholesome root, which he has planted in the presence of the Tathagatas, over to
Discipleship or Pratyekabuddhahood as his reward.And as a rule such Bodhisattvas are grateful
and practise the perfection of wisdom.
