1. The good friendsA Bodhisattva who has set out with earnest intention and wants to win full
enlightenment should from the very beginning tend, love and honour the good friends.Subhuti:
Who are those good friends of a Bodhisattva? The Lord: The Buddhas and Lords, and also
the irreversible Bodhisattvas who are skilful in the Bodhisattva-course, and who instruct
and admonish him in the perfections, who demonstrate and expound the perfection of wisdom.The
perfection of wisdom in particular should be regarded as a Bodhisattva’s good friend.All
the six perfections, in fact, are the good friends of a Bodhisattva.They are his Teacher,
his path, his light, his torch, his illumination, his shelter, his refuge, his place
of rest, his final relief, (397) his island, his mother, his father, and they lead him to
cognition, to understanding, to full enlightenment.For it is in these perfections that the
perfection of wisdom is accomplished.Simply from the six perfections has come forth the all-knowledge
of the Tathagatas who, in the past period, have won full enlightenment and then
entered Nirvana.And so has the all-knowledge of the Tathagatas who in a future period will
win enlightenment,and of the Tathagatas who just now reside in incalculable, immeasurable,
infinite, inconceivable world systems.I also, Subhuti, am a Tathagata who has in this
present period won full enlightenment,and my all-knowledge also has come forth from the six
perfections.For the six perfections contain the thirty-seven dharmas which act as wings
to enlightenment, they contain the four Brahma-dwellings, the four means of conversion,and
any Buddha-dharma there may be, any Buddha-cognition, cognition of the Self-Existent, any
unthinkable, incomparable, immeasurable, incalculable, unequalled cognition, any cognition
which equals the unequalled, any cognition of the all-knowing.Therefore, Subhuti, simply
the six perfections of a Bodhisattva (398) should be known as his good friends. They are
his Teacher, etc., to: they lead him to cognition, to understanding, to full enlightenment.In
addition, a Bodhisattva who trains in the six perfections becomes a true benefactor to
all beings who are in need of one.

But if he wants to train in the six perfections, a Bodhisattva must above all hear this perfection
of wisdom, take it up, bear it in mind, recite, study, spread, demonstrate, expound,
explain and write it, and investigate its meaning, content and method, meditate on it, and
ask questions about it.For this perfection of wisdom directs the six perfections, guides,
leads, instructs and advises them, is their genetrix and nurse.Because, if they are deprived
of the perfection of wisdom, the first five perfections do not come under the concept
of perfections, and they do not deserve to be called ‘perfections.’A Bodhisattva should
therefore train in just this perfection of wisdom if he wishes to get to a state where he
cannot be led astray by others, and to stand firmly in it.
