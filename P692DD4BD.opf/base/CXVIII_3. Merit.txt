3. MeritWhen he stands, trains, progresses, meditates and strives as it is ordained, described
and explained in this perfection of wisdom, he gets rid also of those faults which cause
him to turn away from full enlightenment.(344) If now one Bodhisattva gives himself up to
devotion to perfect wisdom, and does deeds for one day only while dwelling completely in
mental activities connected with perfect wisdom;and if another Bodhisattva lacks in perfect
wisdom, but gives gifts for countless aeons; superior to him is the Bodhisattva who, for
one day only, makes endeavours about perfect wisdom.

A Bodhisattva who for one day only makes endeavours about perfect wisdom begets greater merit
than another Bodhisattva who for countless aeons gives and bestows gifts on all the classes
of holy persons, - from Streamwinners to Tathagatas - but lacks in perfect wisdom.

If that other Bodhisattva should not only bestow gifts as indicated, but in addition observe
the moral precepts, but lack in perfect wisdom,then this Bodhisattva, a dweller in perfect
wisdom, would beget the greater merit if, after he had emerged from his mental work on perfect
wisdom, he would demonstrate dharma.

And that would remain true (345) even if the other Bodhisattva in addition were endowed with
patience.

Even if in addition he would exert vigour, would make endeavours about the trances and wings
of enlightenment, but were still lacking in perfect wisdom;a Bodhisattva who, after he had
given the gift of dharma, as said before, would turn it over to full enlightenment, would
beget a merit greater than his.

Greater still would be the merit of a Bodhisattva who not only gave the gift of dharma, not
only turned it over into full enlightenment,

but employed the kind of turning over which has been taught in the perfection of wisdom.But
if a Bodhisattva, after he has done all that, makes no further efforts about it in meditative
seclusion, (346) then his merit is less than that of one who also makes efforts about
it in meditative seclusion and who, taken hold of by perfect wisdom, causes that meditative
seclusion to be not devoid of perfect wisdom. The latter begets the greater merit.
