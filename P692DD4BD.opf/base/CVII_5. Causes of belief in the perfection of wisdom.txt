5. Causes of belief in the perfection of wisdomSariputra: Bodhisattvas who are reborn here,
and who will here resolutely believe in this deep perfection of wisdom, without hesitation,
doubt or stupefaction, where have they deceased and for how long have they practiced, they
who will follow the doctrine of this perfection of wisdom, understand its meaning, and
instruct others in it both by the method which shows the meaning and by the method which shows
the doctrine? The Lord: One should know that such a Bodhisattva is reborn here after
he has deceased in other world systems where he has honoured and questioned the Buddhas, the
Lords.Any Bodhisattvas who, after he has deceased in other world systems where he has honoured
and questioned the Buddhas, the Lords, is reborn here, would, when he hears this deep
perfection of wisdom being taught, identify this perfection of wisdom with the Teacher,
(177) and be convinced that he is face to face with the Teacher, that he has seen the Teacher.When
the perfection of wisdom is being taught, he listens attentively, pays respect
to it before he hears it, and does not cut the story short.Such a Bodhisattva should be known
as one who has practiced for long,who has honoured many Buddhas.

Subhuti: Is it at all possible to hear the perfection of wisdom, to distinguish and consider
her, to make statements and to reflect about her? Can one explain, or learn, that because
of certain attributes, tokens or signs this is the perfection of wisdom, or that here this
is the perfection of wisdom, or that there that is the perfection of wisdom? The Lord: No
indeed, Subhuti.This perfection of wisdom cannot be expounded, or learned, or distinguished,
or considered, or stated, or reflected upon by means of the skandhas, or by means of
the elements, or by means of the sense-fields.This is a consequence of the fact that all dharmas
are isolated, absolutely isolated.Nor can the perfection of wisdom be understood otherwise
than by the skandhas, elements or sense-fields.For just the very skandhas, elements
and sense-fields are empty, isolated and calmly quiet.It is thus that the perfection of
wisdom and the skandhas, elements and sense-fields are not two, nor divided. As a result of
their emptiness, isolatednessand quietude they cannot be apprehended.The lack of a basis
of apprehension in all dharmas, that is called ‘perfect wisdom.’Where there is no perception,
appellation, conception or conventional expression, there one speaks of ‘perfection of
wisdom.’

(178) Subhuti: As one who has practised for how long should that Bodhisattva be known who makes
endeavours about this deep perfection of wisdom? The Lord: One must make a distinction
in this, owing to the unequal endowment of different Bodhisattvas.
