3. Supreme value of the perfection of wisdomTherefore then, O Lord, if there were two lots;
and if not only this great trichiliocosm, but if all the world systems, countless as the sands
of the Ganges, filled with the relics of the Tathagata, were put down as the first lot;
and a copy of the perfection of wisdom as the second.If I were invited to choose either,
and to take it, I would take just this perfection of wisdom.It is not, O Lord, that I lack
respect for the relics of the Tathagata.My respect for them is a real one.But it is the
perfection of wisdom which pervades all-knowledge, and the relics of the Tathagata are worshipped
because they have come forth from all-knowledge.In consequence the worship of the
perfection of wisdom is in effect a worship of the Buddhas and Lords, past, future and present.

Moreover, O Lord, someone who wants to see, in accordance with dharma, the Buddhas and Lords
who just now exist in immeasurable and incalculable world systems, should course in the perfection
of wisdom, make endeavours in it,develop it.

(100) The Lord: So it is, Kausika.All the Tathagatas owe their enlightenment to just this perfection
of wisdom, - whether they live in the past, future or present.I also, Kausika, just
now a Tathagata, owe my enlightenment to just this perfection of wisdom.

Sakra: A great perfection is this perfection of wisdom.For it allows the Tathagata to rightly
know and behold the thoughts and doings of all beings.The Lord: So it is, Kausika.It is
because a Bodhisattva courses for a long time in this perfection of wisdom that he rightly
knows and beholds the thoughts and doings of all beings.

Sakra: Does a Bodhisattva course only in the perfection of wisdom, and not in the other perfections?
The Lord: He courses in all the six perfections.But it is the perfection of wisdom
(101) which controls the Bodhisattva when he gives a gift, or guards morality, or perfects
himself in patience, or exerts vigour, or enters into trance, or has insight into dharmas.One
cannot get at a distinction or difference between these six perfections, - all of them
upheld by skill in means, dedicated to the perfection of wisdom, dedicated to all-knowledge.Just
as no distinction or difference is conceived between the shadows cast by different
trees in Jambudvipa, - though their colours may differ, and their shapes, and their leaves,
flowers and fruits, and their height and circumference – but they are all just called
‘shadows’; even so one cannot get at a distinction or difference between these six perfections,
- all of them upheld by skill in means, dedicated to the perfection of wisdom, dedicated
to all-knowledge.Sakra: Endowed with great qualities in this perfection of wisdom,with
immeasurable qualities,with boundless qualities!
