2. Effects of perfect wisdomSubhuti: It is indeed a great gain to these sons and daughters of
good family that they should even come to hear of this perfection of wisdom. How much greater
the gain if they take it up, bear it in mind, recite, study, spread, teach, explain
and master it.Their eyes, ears, nose, tongues and bodies will be free from disease, and their
minds free from stupefaction.They will not die a violent death.Many thousands of Gods
will follow closely behind them.(202) Wherever, on the eight, fourteenth and fifteenth day,
when he preaches dharma, a son or daughter of good family teaches the perfection of wisdom,
there he will beget a great deal of merit.The Lord: So it is, Subhuti.Many thousands of
Gods, Subhuti, will follow closely behind that son or daughter of good family, and many
thousands of Gods will come to where perfect wisdom is being taught.Desirous of hearing dharma,they
will all of them protect the preacher of dharma who teaches this perfection of wisdom.For
perfect wisdom is the most precious thing in the world with its Gods, men and Asuras.That
also is a reason why such a person will beget a great deal of merit.On the other
hand, there will be many obstacles to this deep perfection of wisdom being written, taken
up, borne in mind, recited, studied, spread, explained and repeated.For very precious things
provoke much hostility.The more excellent they are, the more violent the hostility.But
this is the most precious thing in the entire world, this perfection of wisdom,which has
been set up and undertaken for the benefit and happiness of the world,by showing that all
dharmas have not been produced nor destroyed, are neither defiled nor purified.(203) But perfect
wisdom does not cling to any dharma, nor defile any dharma, nor take hold of any dharma.For
all these dharmas neither exist nor are they got at.Because it has not been apprehended
is the perfection of wisdom without any stain.‘To be free from stains,’ that is the
same thing as perfect wisdom.And it is because the skandhas are free from stains that perfect
wisdom is without any stain.A Bodhisattva courses in perfect wisdom if he does not perceive
even that.Moreover, this perfection of wisdom does not enter or place itself into any
dharma, it does not reveal or define any dharma, it does not bring in any dharma nor carry
one away.
