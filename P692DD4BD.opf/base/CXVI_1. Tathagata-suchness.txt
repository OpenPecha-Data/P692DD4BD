1. Tathagata-suchnessSubhuti: As the non-observation of all dharmas, to be sure, is this dharma
taught.Nowhere is this dharma obstructed.Through its identity with space this dharma is,
to be sure, marked with non-obstruction, since no traces of it are noticed.It has no counterpart,
because it is without a second.It has no opponent, because it has gone beyond all
opposites.It is without a trace, because it has not been caused to become.It is unproduced,
because there is no occasion for rebirth.It is pathless, because no path is noticed.

Sakra and the Gods: Born after the image of the Lord is this Disciple, the holy Subhuti, the
Elder.For, whichever dharma he demonstrates, he always starts from emptiness.

(307) Subhuti:Because he is not born, is Subhuti, the Elder, born after the image of the Tathagata.He
is born after the image of the Tathagata’s Suchness.As that has neither come nor
gone, so also the Suchness of Subhuti has neither come nor gone.From the very beginning Subhuti
the Elder has been born after the image of the Tathagata’s Suchness.Because the Suchness
of the Tathagata and the Suchness of all dharmas are the same thing,and they are both
the Suchness of Subhuti the Elder.Born after the image of that Suchness is Subhuti the Elder;hence
born after the image of the Tathagata.But that Suchness is also no Suchness,and
after the image of that Suchness has he been born.It is in that sense that the Elder Subhuti
is born after the image of the Tathagata,and that as a result of the established order
of the Suchness of the Tathagata.Subhuti’s Suchness is immutable and unchangeable, undiscriminated
and undifferentiated, just as the Suchness of the Tathagata.It is thus that Subhuti
the Elder, immutable, unchangeable, undiscriminated, undifferentiated, through that Suchness,
is born after the image of the Tathagata.And just as the Suchness of the Tathagata,
which is immutable and undifferentiated, is nowhere obstructed, so also the Suchness of
all dharmas, which is also immutable and undifferentiated.For the Suchness of the Tathagata,
and the Suchness of all dharmas, they are both one single Suchness, not two, not divided.A
non-dual Suchness, however, is nowhere, is from nowhere, belongs to nowhere.It is because
it is a Suchness which belongs nowhere that it is non-dual.It is therefore through an
unmade Suchness that the Elder Subhuti is born after the image of the Tathagata.An unmade
Suchness, however, is at no time not Suchness(308) and therefore it is non-dual.It is in this
sense that the Elder Subhuti is born after the image of the Tathagata.Just as the Suchness
of the Tathagata is undiscriminated and undifferentiated, at all times and in all dharmas,
so also the Suchness of Subhuti.And for that reason, although we seem to have a duality
when Subhuti has been conjured up from the Suchness of the Tathagata, nevertheless nothing
real has been lopped off that Suchness, which remains unbroken, because one cannot apprehend
an actually real agent that could break it apart.In that sense is Subhuti the Elder
born after the image of the Tathagata.As the Suchness of the Tathagata is not outside the
Suchness of all dharmas, so also the Suchness of Subhuti.But what is not outside the Suchness
of all dharmas, that is not of anything not the Suchness.The Suchness of Subhuti is
therefore just the same as the Suchness of all dharmas.Subhuti the Elder has undergone the
experience of that Suchness by imitating in himself the unaltered Suchness,but in actual
fact no one has anywhere undergone a process of imitation.It is in this sense that Subhuti
the Elder is born after the image of the Tathagata.As the Suchness of the Tathagata is neither
past, nor future, nor present, so also the Suchness of all dharmas.As born in the image
of that Suchness is Subhuti called “born after the image of the Tathagata.”Because it
is also through the Suchness of the Tathagata [and not only his own] that he has conformed
to Suchness. It is just through the Suchness of the Tathagata that he has conformed to past
Suchness,and it is just through past Suchness that he has conformed to the Suchness of
the Tathagata.And so with the future and the present.It is through the Suchness of the Tathagata
that he has conformed to past, future and present Suchness,and it is through past,
future and present Suchness that he has conformed to the Suchness of the Tathagata.In this
sense the Suchness of Subhuti, and past, future and present Suchness, and the Suchness of
the Tathagata, are not two, nor divided.The Suchness of all dharmas and the Suchness of Subhuti
are therefore not two, nor divided.(309) And also, the Suchness of the Lord when he
was a Bodhisattva that is the Suchness of the Lord when he had won full enlightenment.And
that is the Suchness through which a Bodhisattva, when he has definitely won full enlightenment,
comes to be called a ‘Tathagata.’
