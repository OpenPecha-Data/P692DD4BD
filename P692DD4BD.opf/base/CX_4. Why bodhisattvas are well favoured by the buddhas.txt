4. Why bodhisattvas are well favoured by the buddhasSubhuti: It is wonderful to see the extent
to which the Tathagata has well taken hold of the Bodhisattvas, has well encompassed and
favoured them.(219) The Lord: It is because these Bodhisattvas have practised for the weal
and happiness of the many, out of pity for the world.Out of pity for Gods and men, for
the benefit, the weal and happiness of a great mass of people do they want to win the supreme
enlightenment,and thereafter to demonstrate the supreme dharma.
